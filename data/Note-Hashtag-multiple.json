The anxiety grows stronger every day. In reality, there are still two weeks left, but it feels like I'll be back at work tomorrow. Suddenly, I really want to quit, but I can't bring myself to do it [Sigh R]\n.\nMy sources of anxiety are threefold\n1‚É£Ô∏è I can no longer be a 24/7 mom to my baby\nFrom the time my baby was born until now, the total time I've been away from him doesn't even add up to 24 hours. Every time I go out alone, I have to plan for a long time. It seems like leaving him with grandma wouldn't be a problem, but as a mom, I overthink. I'm afraid he'll cry and fuss, and I worry that grandma will be stressed and not take good care of him. Maybe it's not that he can't live without me, but that I can't live without him [Sigh R]. The thought of not seeing him for 9-10 hours at work is heartbreaking.\n2‚É£Ô∏è Soon to be a 'Beijing Drifter' with my elderly and young\nSince my home is in Hebei and my job is in Beijing, I have no choice but to take my baby and mother-in-law to rent a place in Beijing. Thinking about the rental environment in Beijing, either too expensive to afford or too dilapidated and depressing, isn't this just subjecting my elderly and young to suffering? The thought of this makes me sad and want to cry. My baby is still so small and has to follow his parents to drift in Beijing, which makes me feel very sorry for him. My mother-in-law hasn't traveled far much, and I worry she won't adapt.\n3‚É£Ô∏è Equivalent to being in a long-distance relationship with my husband\nAlthough both of us work in Beijing, one is in Shunyi and the other in Haidian, miles apart. Even in Beijing, it's still like being in a long-distance relationship. I've thought about finding a new job, but I haven't received my postpartum allowance yet, and I'm still breastfeeding. Which company would be willing to accept me?\n.\nToday, my husband took some things to the rental place first. While packing, I suddenly broke down in tears, thinking about how small our baby is and having to wander with us. I feel so inadequate. If there could be stability for a lifetime, who would choose to wander? When will this drifting end? Should I quit my job to stay at home with the baby, or should I take the baby to roam the world? It's so hard...",

Listen to My Sharing Quickly\n    Note Content: The chip industry has always been regarded as the 'heart' of the technology industry, serving as the infrastructure of the information age. Despite the positive growth prospects of the chip industry, we need to be more meticulous in selecting targets within this industry.\n\nFirstly, from the perspective of the chip market, we can pay attention to mainstream chip manufacturers, such as Intel, Samsung, AMD, etc. These companies have a good market share globally and also possess strong R&D capabilities and technological reserves, and are expected to make more progress in areas such as 5G and cloud computing in the future.\n\nSecondly, we can focus on the fields of chip applications, such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, smart manufacturing, etc. The development speed in these fields is very rapid, and the demand for the chip industry is gradually increasing. In these fields, some emerging chip companies are also worth noting, such as Nvidia, Xilinx, etc.\n\nFinally, we need to consider the industrial chain of the chip industry, including production links such as chip equipment and materials. In these links, leading enterprises such as Applied Materials, Lam Research Corporation, etc., should not be overlooked.\n\nOverall, the future development of the chip industry is still worth looking forward to, but investors need to pay attention to the details and changes within the industry, select targets with potential, in order to achieve better investment returns.",

So happy for herüò≠ At that time, this sister was in a very anxious state, and now there is finally some response~\n-\t\n\nüìñBackground: At that time, the diviner's company was facing layoffs, so she started preparing to look for a new job in advance, asking when she could receive a new offer.\n-\nThe first house cusp star Saturn is retrograde in Aquarius, representing the offer result in the tenth house cusp star Mars.\nSaturn and Mars form a trine, indicating the diviner will find a new job in 7 days/7 weeks/7 months. The Moon in Aries, a cardinal sign, but in the second house, means the progress of things is steady, not too fast or too slow, so it can be judged that a new offer will be received around 7 weeks.\nHowever, Mars in Gemini has no dignity, so this offer might just be an ordinary offer rather than a particularly satisfactory one.\n-\nLooking at the Moon in the second house in Aries, aspected by Mars, and Mars also in the fourth house, it shows that the diviner urgently wants a high-paying offer for some family matters (later the diviner mentioned it was because she needed to buy a house and pay the mortgage with her husband, so there was significant financial pressure).\n-\nCurrently, Saturn is in its domicile + retrograde, the diviner is both confused and under great pressure, at such times as an astrologer, one must provide some breakthrough ideas to help the diviner!

It was not easy at all. I am really grateful to have chosen the entertainment live streaming industry and to have found a reliable team. Otherwise, I wouldn't know what to do.\nüë©üèª I am a divorced single mother from the post-90s. Previously, I tried entrepreneurship several times, including housekeeping, nail services, catering, clothing, fruits, and all the industries you can think of. I have tried them all. Due to various influences, my entrepreneurial endeavors failed. I invested all my savings, and not only did I not make money, but I also ended up with a debt of 180,000 yuan. I felt depressed for two months. During those two months, I was extremely anxious, with elderly parents and young children to support, and a fixed monthly expenditure of several thousand yuan. I really couldn't stop. Some friends in the media industry told me that being an entertainment streamer can be quite lucrative and suggested I give it a try.\n‚úäüèª I gave myself half a year. Initially, being an entertainment streamer was not easy at all. There were hardly any viewers in the live stream, and I didn't know what to broadcast. I almost gave up, but my team kept encouraging me. I thought to myself, if I wasn't afraid of entrepreneurial failure, this shouldn't be a big deal. I persisted, and by the second month, I earned 30,000 yuan! This gave me a lot of confidence.\nüìö During the early days of streaming, my team and I were either live streaming or reviewing performances. It was really tough going from 0 to 1. Others would stream for 6 hours a day, but I would stream for 12 hours. I couldn't sleep at night, so I would get up, put on makeup, and continue streaming. I knew that the more I streamed, the closer I would get to paying off my debts. With this determination, I persisted for half a year, and I finally did it. At the moment of my last repayment, I felt a huge sense of relief and cried for a long time.\nContinue streaming and saving money, aiming to break through a million yuan in annual income [fistR]\nSometimes, when an opportunity comes, you really need to seize it.

        "content": "Note Title: Senior Sister with 85+ in College Entrance Exam Politics Shares Notes\n    Note Content: 1. Since choosing politics as a subject in the second semester of my first year of high school, I have always been particularly fond of politics. Coupled with the fact that our politics teacher is very capable, my politics scores have rarely dropped below 90, especially during my senior year, when I never scored below 90. Due to personal factors, I only scored 86 in the college entrance exam, which is my only regret [crying emoji R].\n        2. During my first round of review, apart from memorizing outlines, reading textbooks, taking school exams, and doing the 'Five Three' politics exercises (mandated by the school), I didn't do any other politics questions. However, during the first round of review, I spent about 3 hours each day memorizing and reviewing politics, then summarizing thought templates and common mistake points.\n               3. After each exam, I analyzed every major question, from the setup to the material, to my thought process, and my own mistakes. Then, I organized all the common mistake points from each test paper by book. Textbooks are very important; every word matters. Start by looking at the table of contents, from the book title to the unit title, lesson title, frame title, and each section title. You can organize it in the form of a mind map with brackets, especially for philosophy and culture. Compulsory Book Four must clarify all principle knowledge points and names. Also, understand the names and contents of comprehensive explorations, preferably memorize them. Then delve into the textbook, organize common mistake points, and group them with test papers. There are also points that need to be distinguished, and some concepts need to be organized and memorized. If your school has outlines, you need to know the meaning and location of every word and phrase. I started organizing major question templates late, roughly dividing them by textbook and some general ones, based on my major question accumulation book. I grouped all the same types of questions together, then grouped the same books together, and found templates based on points. By the mock exams in the second semester of my senior year, I could write content based on a keyword and know what to write for different question types. Our regular exams had many long major questions, but I found that the college entrance exam was not like that. I was very adept at answering the major questions in the college entrance exam, and there was no opportunity for long-winded answers because the space provided was limited. This year, I thought the multiple-choice questions were difficult; I spent over 40 minutes on them, and finished the major questions in less than 40 minutes, with some final touches.\n        4. After receiving the paper, there are 5 minutes. I suggest not looking at the multiple-choice questions, but directly at the major questions, skimming through to determine the order of answering, as the difficulty is not arranged from low to high in sequence. Sometimes the later questions are simpler. If there is time, you can find the simplest question, like a short essay or speech, to outline. Start the exam by writing this, then go back to the multiple-choice questions. I found that starting with major questions can stabilize my mindset.\n       5. After the first round, don't put aside the outlines. At my craziest, I memorized an entire outline in a day. In the last two months, I basically reviewed them once a week and could recite them fluently.",

After advanced learning, while classmates are still struggling to understand, you have already mastered and started tackling the difficulties.\nüéàIncrease confidence in your own learning abilities\nAfter advanced learning, keeping up with the teacher's pace is naturally not a problem. When you understand what the teacher says at once and learn quickly, with surplus energy, your test scores will significantly improve, greatly boosting your learning confidence, full of internal motivation and stamina.\nüéàGradually develop good habits of active learning\nAfter advanced learning, confidence soars, and learning shifts from passive to active. After tasting the benefits of advanced learning, you are more willing to stride forward, transforming from 'I have to learn' to 'I want to learn' this active learning habit, once developed, benefits for life.\nAdvanced learning for average students will break the vicious cycle of 'not wanting to learn, not learning well, lacking confidence' and step into the virtuous cycle of 'I want to learn, rapid progress, having confidence'. Average students, through advanced learning, may join the ranks of top students. Top students, through advanced learning, can remain unbeatable.\nHowever, advanced learning must be based on learning abilities, otherwise it is meaningless.

The sense of unworthiness and low self-worth makes it difficult for you to find an accurate and comfortable balance point in your intimate relationship with him.\nThis point makes you very frustrated. You worry that Kim Min Kyu might leave you one day because of your conflicts. You love him very much, but you don't know how to love him properly.\nActually, he knows everything. Your habitual avoidance, vulnerability, and pseudo-aggressiveness are all seen by him, but he can always accurately read the hidden needs behind these behaviors, emotional needs.\nWhen you first started dating, you were very conflicted about whether to cling to him, because you had heard more than once that even in a relationship, men don't like a clingy partner. You worried that too much love would be overwhelming for him, so you tried hard to keep some emotional distance from him.\nYou put all your effort into establishing an independent persona.\nAt that time, you and Kim Min Kyu hadn't lived together yet. Women living alone always encounter many troubles. You solved what you could by yourself until one time when strange symbols appeared at the door, and the surveillance camera always showed the same sneaky man, which made you think that maybe you should tell Kim Min Kyu.\nKim Min Kyu moved into your house with his luggage that very night. You thought he was angry, and indeed he was. He was quite upset after seeing the broken light bulb, the empty refrigerator, and the instant noodles on the table.\nYou didn't dare to speak behind him. Kim Min Kyu, with his back to you, tried to adjust his emotions. He was angry that you couldn't take care of yourself and wouldn't bother him.\nHe could sense your emotional changes. He knew what you were worried about, so when he turned to face you, he no longer frowned, and his action of embracing you was very gentle. You still remember his careful yet firm grip, 'Baby, I am your boyfriend, so taking care of you and loving you is the most basic thing. Don't be afraid to bother me.'\nSo the broken light bulb in the house lit up again, the refrigerator was filled with milk and vegetables by Kim Min Kyu, the instant noodles on the table were replaced with various fruits, and there was even a vase full of fresh flowers. These changes were all Kim Min Kyu's subtle hints for you to slowly get closer to him.\nWhen you first brought him home, you were very nervous. Your original family was not harmonious, and the suppression and control of Chinese parents over their children permeated every corner.\nBecause of Kim Min Kyu, you first stood against your father. Your father said he had no objection to Kim Min Kyu, but settling in South Korea was out of the question. To ease the atmosphere, Kim Min Kyu said he could also come to China with you, but your father just smiled and waved his hand without saying anything more.\nYour father's reaction brought out the deepest anger and shame from the bottom of your heart. For the first time, you threw your chopsticks and shouted at your father, saying that even if you didn't marry Kim Min Kyu, you would still stay far away from him. As expected, your father's slap landed firmly on your face.\nYou ran out of the house, and by the time Kim Min Kyu finished talking to your father and chased after you, you were nowhere to be seen.\n\n\t\nSubsequent plq",

I took the Materials Science major exam, studying the fundamentals of materials science. For someone like me who is crossing disciplines, I had no prior exposure at all. But! At this moment, aiming to upgrade my academic credentials and get into a 211 university was the best choice, so I made up my mind to get in no matter what!! Importantly, there's no discrimination!!!\n2. Initially, when I looked at the textbook, I was utterly clueless, not knowing how or where to start. Everyone knows how undergraduate studies go, so I had confidence in crossing disciplines. Everyone starts anew and studies diligently. As long as I carefully organize and sort out the knowledge points, there shouldn't be any problems. After all, the more you cross disciplines, the more meticulously you need to study compared to those in the same field.\n3. Regarding study methods, I first consulted senior students about future employment prospects, which are still good since it's a 211 university. I bought study materials from senior students, watched Professor Wang Yongxin's lectures from Northwestern Polytechnical University, highlighted key knowledge points based on the exam syllabus, meticulously organized the knowledge points, categorized them, and tackled them one by one. It essentially boils down to intense memorization, wishing I could memorize the entire book. Later, I found that highlighting key points saved me half the effort in organizing. Next was understanding and memorizing, practicing extensively to master the textbook. I noticed that the repetition rate of exam questions each year is quite high. If you study diligently, scoring 110-120 is definitely achievable!\n‚ö†Ô∏è When buying materials, make sure to purchase from seniors who have successfully passed in your major, not from resellers. Everyone should be discerning. Wishing everyone a smooth journey to success [PartyR]",

        "content": "Note Title: Where is the Future Development of 'Targeted Training Sergeants'?\n    Note Content: ÔÇ∑Advantages\nFirstly, the score threshold for targeted sergeants is not high, and it is almost equivalent to tuition-free. For those with average college entrance examination results, they can at least obtain a college diploma, and can also upgrade to a bachelor's degree in the future. Moreover, there is a clear national policy that allows direct exemption from the examination for upgrading to a bachelor's degree upon retirement. Additionally, the tuition fees for the period of study are refunded upon enlistment.\n\nSecond, you can take the military academy entrance exam to become an officer. To put it bluntly, in the second year after joining the army, you can participate in the military exam, and the age requirement is just right. The content of the military exam is also high school knowledge. However, the difference is that it covers fewer knowledge points, about 60% of high school, and the difficulty of the questions is simple, equivalent to a high school monthly exam. Many young brothers review the military exam content during the targeted training period and successfully enter the military academy after enlistment. Upon graduation, they become officers, with the same status, prospects, and treatment as those who enter the military academy through the college entrance examination.\nThird, targeted sergeants can learn skills and are guaranteed job placement. The recruitment of targeted sergeants is determined according to the talent needs of the army, and because it is targeted training, you can know your own military specialty from the beginning. Whether it is the navy, army, air force, or armed police, you have a clear direction. Years later, you will find that some top students from 985 and 211 universities in your class are still struggling to find jobs or take exams! You will understand that the failure in the college entrance examination does not negate a person; personal ability and choice are the most important.\n\nFourth, the salary after enlistment is about 5500 yuan. After graduation, you will be assigned to the army with the rank of a corporal, and your salary will increase annually, and it is 13 months' salary!\n\nFifth, parents receive half-price medical treatment, and spouses and children receive free medical treatment. This is a policy that has been implemented since January 1, 2022, and it is very beneficial!\n\nSixth, various subsidies are high. If either parent is over 60 years old, they receive 600 yuan per month as 'support money'. Married wives receive 500 yuan per month as 'spouse honorarium', and there is also a 1000 yuan 'separation allowance'. Families with children receive 500 yuan per month as 'child care and education fee'.\n\nSeventh, after serving for 12 years, the state assigns formal jobs. If you fail the military academy entrance exam in the second year, it is still good to serve for 12 years and be assigned a job, because during your 12 years as a sergeant, the average annual salary is 100,000 yuan, totaling over a million yuan in 12 years, and finally, you are also assigned a job (local public institution/state-owned enterprise). Where do you think you are inferior to those top students? Many are not even as good as you!\nÔÇ∑Next, let's talk about the disadvantages\nFirstly, military management is strict. If you are used to being free and easy, you may not be used to it at first, but it will be fine after a few months of adaptation, which is normal.\nSecond, the initial training in the army may feel hard. After all, the state supports you to be able to fight and win battles, so essential military capabilities and qualities are required.\n\nOverall, this path has its pros and cons. Be prepared to endure hardships, and the state will give you a future. Conversely, it is impossible to expect good things without effort; the army does not support idlers!",

It's cheaper to fly to Kunming and then take the high-speed train to Xishuangbanna, which takes about three hours and is very convenient.\nAccommodation: In Kunming, we stayed near the high-speed train station for convenience. In Xishuangbanna, you can stay near Manting Park or Gaozhuang. Although Gaozhuang is relatively noisy, it's centrally located near major tourist attractions, making travel very convenient, and it's also where most tour groups gather.\nActivities: On our first morning in Xishuangbanna, we immediately found a makeup shop for Dai Sister looks and then headed to Manting Park for some photos [Grinning][Grinning][Grinning], (PS: For tips and recommendations on Dai Sister makeup in Xishuangbanna, see my other note) we didn't hire a photographer, we took all the photos ourselves with a camera!

I have some experience with the Law of Attraction practices that weren't entirely successful, and I've been pondering the differences. After reading this book, I finally got the answer.\n\t\nThe Law of Attraction emphasizes the reality level:\n‚úîÔ∏èIf you want something, think about it, attract it, create it\n‚úîÔ∏èThis is clearly explained in many books and growth courses as the underlying logic of making your wishes come true. If you're interested, you can message me privately\n\t\nOn the soul level:\n‚úîÔ∏èEverything you want to possess depends on whether you have accumulated the corresponding virtue.\n‚úîÔ∏èThe intention behind what you want, whether it's for yourself or for others.\n\t\nüôÇ‚Äç‚ÜîÔ∏è\n\t\nSo\nWhen your soul has a certain starting point, the Law of Attraction may not work. Because at the same time, you need...\n‚úîÔ∏èTo cultivate virtues that match\n‚úîÔ∏èTo refine your intentions\n\t\nüìñüìñ'Self-Image Plastic Surgery for Transforming Life'\n‚ñ™Ô∏èThe author of this book is a plastic surgeon with a scientific value orientation. He says that every plastic surgeon is essentially a psychologist.\n‚ñ™Ô∏èThe book discusses many issues about appearance and the psychological 'appearance' problems that affect many people's lives. For example, after getting a scar on the face, the personality deteriorates, which in turn affects work and life.\n\t\nSharing a few useful insights for me\n\t\n‚ñ´Ô∏èDon't strive, don't use willpower\nStriving and willpower reinforce the memory and sensation of 'failure', thereby attracting more failures. You should forget the pressure, fully enjoy the present, live in the moment, use your body to receive all the information the universe provides, and when the time comes, creativity will naturally emerge.\n‚ñ´Ô∏èScars on the body form because when wounds heal, the reverse pulling force that brings the skin on both sides closer is often slightly greater. So scar tissue forms at the connection.\nAnd it's the same when we are emotionally hurt. We use a force of avoidance/resistance/healing. This force is not balanced. So after our hearts are hurt, we develop defenses, and when a similar situation arises again, the heart does not naturally experience the scenario.\n\t\n‚ñ´Ô∏èWhen the body is absolutely relaxed, it does not produce emotions like fear, anxiety, or anger. Our body needs to 'do something' to generate corresponding emotions.\nYou can start with the body, do some relaxing meditation and introspection every day, perceive the body, remember the feeling of relaxation, and then deal with emotional reactions\n\t\n‚ñ´Ô∏èThe book also talks about the Law of Attraction. When this attraction is meant to be yours, you experience it in your imagination, attract it effortlessly, and naturally and easily enter the state of possessing it.\nWhen you can't easily imagine it, try to clear your negative energy, past blockages (whether from the family of origin or social influences), and accumulate good deeds.",

My preparation for the exam üâê was not early, and my daily study time was also limited. However, within the limited time, I managed to achieve a relatively satisfactory TCM comprehensive score.

The mnemonics and summaries I found are incredibly simple and easy to remember, focusing on key points rather than everything, allowing me to conquer the TCM comprehensive exam within the limited time.\n\nI will organize all the materials I used and share them with you according to a time plan, for a small fee. Don't rush to criticize me; this material can save you from many detours and help you easily master the TCM comprehensive exam.\nThis material not only includes study resources but, more importantly, the methods and key points of learning, so you won't feel lost, ensuring you are planned, prepared, and unconfused, steadily succeeding in your first attempt.",

A temporary worker employed by the company filed a labor arbitration after leaving, demanding double salary compensation for not signing a written labor contract, among other claims. Ultimately, after arbitration, first instance, and second instance, it was determined that both parties had established a non-full-time employment relationship, which could be agreed upon orally, and accordingly, all of the opponent's claims were rejected. With the efforts of our lawyer, we successfully avoided losses for the client.\n[Student Party R] Many workers believe that in the absence of a written labor contract, arbitration is almost certain. However, they all overlook the uniqueness of each case and the parties involved. There are no completely identical cases in the world, and law is not about applying formulas. All cases require specific analysis, and when necessary, seek guidance from professionals. It also reminds all companies not to have a fluke mentality, to ensure proper employment practices, and to hire professional teams to provide compliance services if possible.\n[Student Party R] Finally, I hope that in the current difficult market environment, both enterprises and workers can work together to build and maintain harmonious labor relations and reduce unnecessary disputes.",

Combining my personal experience, I write whatever comes to mind.\nI took the Civil and Commercial Law exam at a non-double-first-class university in Guangzhou, with an initial score of 382\n\t\n1Ô∏è‚É£ Preparation started in July, and I was also preparing for the legal exam in the middle. The whole process mainly involved memorizing books. I didn't buy books from institutions, just used reference books to memorize.\n2Ô∏è‚É£ For Master's in Law, I think the most important thing is memorizing books, everything else is secondary. There was a tutoring book sold by a postgraduate institution called the Blue Treasure Book. I was very hesitant about whether to buy it, but it was too expensive, so I didn't buy it in the end ü§£. Using tutoring books to memorize cannot cover everything. The most important thing during the exam is to output content. Tutoring books simplify the content, which I personally think is not conducive to output.\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Besides reference books, I bought Shengcai Notes on Jurisprudence and Constitutional Law to determine key question types and for supplementation.\n4Ô∏è‚É£ Should you take notes while memorizing books?\nI didn't. For me, taking notes is unnecessary. However, during the memorization process, I would determine the question types, organize while memorizing, and categorize them into definitions, short answers, and discussions.\nFor example, Definition: Justifiable Defense; Short Answer/Discussion: Elements of Justifiable Defense\n5Ô∏è‚É£ Should you watch legal exam courses?\nI watched legal exam courses. It's quite helpful to watch civil law courses when you have time. Sometimes, knowledge points that I didn't notice while memorizing would be discovered while watching legal exam courses. I recommend Li Jianwei for civil law.\n6Ô∏è‚É£ Should you enroll in a class or buy materials from senior students?\nDuring the preparation process, I only bought reference books and Shengcai Notes. I added a senior sister who had passed the exam on WeChat to understand the situation. I didn't buy other materials, as the reference books were completely sufficient.",

Specifically, we propose a theoretical optimal learning for LM. We first set a goal to optimize LM learning in the view of 'LM training lossless compression' by maximizing the data compression ratio. Then, we derive a theorem named Learning Law to reveal the dynamic properties of the optimal learning process under our goal. This theorem is then validated through experiments on linear classification and real-world language modeling tasks. Finally, our empirical validation shows that the optimal learning LM essentially originates from the improved scaling law of the LM coefficients, indicating great promise and significance in designing practical learning acceleration methods. Our code can be found at https://aka.ms/LearningLaw.\n>All the above content is from KimiChat, for a more detailed understanding of the paper, please read the original text carefully",

Also, I prefer electric door suction, so no one will slam the door loudly when getting in or out. The car's smart system doesn't need to be overly advanced; I've looked at Audi and Volvo, and their infotainment systems seem a bit outdated (I really like these two cars and have test-driven them, but I'm just talking about the infotainment part).\nAre there any recommendations within 300,000 RMB, preferably sedans, either pure electric or pure gasoline? I previously considered the Li Auto L6 and was impressed by how drivable SUVs can be, but it's too big and has quite a few issues. Since I'm still young and single with no family needs, I might as well enjoy driving a sedan while I'm still relatively young. Thank you everyone.\nOh, and noise is also an important consideration.

        "content": "Note Title: How are people who dropped out of college doing now?\n    Note Content: I am an art major in a normal second-tier university, thinking of dropping out. In high school, I had great ambition and goals, determined to get into an undergraduate program and then pursue a master's degree. During the art training period, I slept only four hours a day, waking up at 5 AM and going to bed at 12:30 PM. What supported me was my love for college, my parents' expectations, and their financial investment. I was the top student in my class in the art exam. However, when I returned to school to study culture in the second half of my senior year, I felt I had lost my previous passion and even doubted my ability to pass the cultural exams. But thinking that I had endured so much for the art exam, it seemed too unworthy to give up. So, I continued with my exhausted body, but I had no heart for studying. I kept asking myself why this was happening. My cultural grades in high school were always in the top 20 of my grade, but after returning from training, my grades plummeted. Coupled with various pressures, I often cried during class. At one point, I couldn't handle it and took a few days off to rest at home. But when I returned to the classroom and saw the pile of papers and homework, I started crying again. I felt there was something wrong with me, but I didn't dare to confirm it, fearing to tell my parents and teachers. Even now, as I write these words, I am crying. I don't understand why this is happening. When I worked hard to get into college, I encountered new difficulties. I never thought of dropping out in high school, but it started in my freshman year. Due to the physical and mental issues from high school, my ability to handle stress has worsened. Poor relationships with roommates, being scolded by teachers in professional classes, made me cry repeatedly. When I mentioned this to my friends, they advised me to endure and not to drop out impulsively. But this thought has been in my mind for a long time. During the winter vacation, I took a part-time job and experienced it, which made me more determined. I would rather work than go to school. But I dare not tell my parents, as I know they won't agree. What should I do? Now, I am just slacking off at school, wanting to strive but unable to move. Maybe I will visit the school's psychological counseling center and then go to the hospital for confirmation. Because no normal person would cry for two days straight over something, unable to control it, crying as soon as I open my eyes [crying emoji]. I hope they can understand and support my thoughts. I deeply know that I don't like the current education system and understand that learning never stops, just in different ways. Can my friends give me some advice? I am really struggling to bear it.",

On the 17th and 18th, he barely ate anything (after consulting various sources). It was said that kittens don't eat much when they first arrive in a new environment and are not adapted. The cattery's after-sales service suggested feeding him chicken breast mixed with cat food, which he luckily liked. However, on the 19th, when I came home from work, I found three piles of kitten feces üí© with blood ü©∏ on my bed, which really scared me. I immediately asked the after-sales service, and they said it might be parasites. They advised me to take him to a partner hospital the next day for a check-up. I quickly isolated the kitten in a cage and took him for an examination as soon as I got off work the next day. It turned out to be feline distemper, which was a huge shock to me. Such a small kitten, only three days after bringing him home! And I also have two other adult cats at home, I can't imagine how devastating it would be if they got infected. I cried on my way home and bought disinfectant to sanitize everything.\nNow, the situation is that little San San is receiving treatment at my hospital. The two original residents are staying at home to observe their mental state and stool condition. After observing for a few days, they will go for a test strip to detect feline distemper. Flipping through the tags I made for the three cats on the app the day before yesterday, I feel sad thinking that San San probably won't get to use them. Upon review, it's clear that the kitten had no appetite and later had bloody stools, indicating symptoms early on. Yet the cattery still argued that the distemper was due to stress after coming home, which was incredibly frustrating. It's very likely that San San already had distemper at the cattery. This disease has an extremely high transmission rate, and other cats at the cattery might have it too! People have feelings, hearts are made of flesh, and other pet owners would be heartbroken if they found their pets had issues. It's so upsetting.\nLater, I asked my friend, whose cat was also bought from a cattery and developed distemper three days after bringing it home. Because we all love our kittens and want to take care of them, she spent 10,000 yuan to finally cure her cat.\nSo, girls, don't buy cats from catteries!!!!!! Many of them are 'week cats'. Even though pet insurance can reimburse the costs, it's heart-wrenching to see your kitten sick.",

This year I got married and feel that the GLC is more suitable for family use. My husband and I have a combined monthly salary of about 10,000. The car will mainly be driven by me for commuting and weekend outings. My husband will also buy a car in the future. I have savings of 230,000, family sponsorship of 100,000, and plan to take a loan of 100,000. The down payment is not a problem, but I'm worried about the subsequent maintenance costs. After buying, we will have almost no savings left, and we will rely on ourselves for car maintenance. We also plan to have a baby in the future. Family members and my husband think it's fine to buy a car that costs around 200,000, as we are not running a business. But I really like Mercedes and there's a bit of vanity involved. Both my family and my husband's family have average financial situations. Dear friends, should I buy the GLC or the C260? Or do you advise against buying a Mercedes?

I also tried liquid fasting, high-protein diets, 16+8, and 5+2 methods. Throughout this process, I basically maintained regular exercise. Amidst all the struggles, I endured the anxiety, frustration, and disappointment of weight loss, choosing not to give up and continuously reflecting and learning effective weight loss methods, summarizing lessons from both discipline and indulgence.\nUltimately, I discovered that the ultimate secret to weight loss is not about eating less or starving oneself, nor about rejecting high-calorie foods, but about controlling portions. Most people who are obese are unable to perceive their own sense of fullness, often eating too much and overstuffing themselves. Therefore, when those with a higher or lower body mass want to lose weight, especially those with a higher mass, they need to set a suitable portion for each meal that makes them feel about 6.7/10 full. It's okay to leave food behind but not to eat more than the set portion. If there is a strong feeling of hunger between meals, the criterion being feeling too lazy to do anything and lacking energy, then it's okay to have a small snack. The purpose of this is to prevent extreme hunger in the next meal, where one can't perceive their fullness and control their intake. By sticking to this for a month and forming a habit, there's less need to quantify portions, as one can sense when they are 6.7/10 full, thus finding the most suitable diet for themselves. I believe this will naturally lead to reaching one's ideal weight.",

From this moment on, please always pay attention to your condition. If you feel uncomfortable, go to the hospital immediately. Do not think you are being overly sensitive. This is not being sensitive, but being responsible for yourself and your baby.\n[Balloon R] Next, please calm down and find a free time. Go to the hospital on an empty stomach in the morning. At this point, you don't need to worry about which hospital to go to. Just find one close to home. Any hospital with an obstetrics and gynecology department will do. If the departments are combined, register for obstetrics and gynecology. If they are separate, register for obstetrics. This can avoid the embarrassment of the doctor asking you whether you want to keep the baby. You don't need to register for a specialist appointment. Just choose any doctor with fewer patients. Tell the doctor you might be pregnant and ask them to prescribe a check-up. You only need to check hcg and progesterone for now. Don't rush to get an ultrasound.\n[Balloon R] Once the results are out, if hcg levels are significantly increased, it means you are pregnant. If hcg exceeds 3000, you can get an ultrasound. If it hasn't exceeded, wait another ten days or half a month. At this point, you don't need to focus on progesterone. My progesterone was a bit low at the time, but the doctor said that without seeing the gestational sac, there's no need to worry about the fetus. So don't worry. If it really doesn't develop well, it's better for it to naturally pass at this stage. You won't be in too much pain. Survival of the fittest is a natural law.\n\t\n[Fireworks R] Alright, now you have completed today's tasks. Next, go home and wait. Rest more, avoid overexertion, do not engage in strenuous exercise, do not smoke or drink, and keep a calm mindset.",

Pork rib noodle (1 liang) + Dry Shao Noodle (1 liang) üí∞ The price is a bit high (the pork rib noodle is a clear soup style, ribs are large, extremely tender, and the soup is tasty. The dry Shao noodle portion is small but flavorful).\nüçûMount Emei Crispy Bread ‚úÖ See photo in P2\nOriginal flavor, 2 yuan each. Bought 5, freshly baked, and quite delicious. Recommended for those who like buns. It takes about 40 minutes per batch; pay first, register a number, and pick it up when it‚Äôs ready.\nüç°Pull-String Candied Hawthorn ü´£ See photo in P3\n10 yuan per skewer.

Renewal is the most troublesome issue, as it takes over seven years of renewal to qualify for permanent residency. Otherwise, previous efforts may be in vain.\n\nüíº There are two ways to renew the High Talent and Quality Talent visa: one is through employment in Hong Kong, and the other is by starting a company in Hong Kong. Many people are not ready to develop or settle in Hong Kong, especially those elite talent groups with annual incomes exceeding 2.5 million HKD. They often have their own companies or businesses in mainland China, making it difficult to move to Hong Kong. While joining a Hong Kong insurance company is a good option, more people choose to open a company in Hong Kong. After all, Hong Kong has low taxes and many corporate subsidy policies!\n\nüí∞ Hong Kong has a subsidy policy encouraging SMEs to expand business in mainland China, called the 'BUD Special Support Subsidy.' As long as enterprises have actual business operations in Hong Kong and plan to expand to mainland China, they can apply for the subsidy from the Hong Kong government. Each enterprise can apply for a subsidy of up to 7 million HKD, with a maximum of 1 million HKD per application. For those who already have their own companies in mainland China, this is an added benefit! It not only solves the renewal problem but also allows them to apply for üá≠üá∞ subsidies to help fund their mainland businesses. Furthermore, starting a company in Hong Kong allows them to contribute to MPF as self-employed individuals, solving the renewal issue.\n\nHong Kong Self-Employed Renewal Criteria/BUD Application Requirements:\nCommon Requirements‚úÖ:\n1Ô∏è‚É£ 3 million HKD turnover with bank transaction records;\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Actual business with signed contracts with clients;\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Commercial office space with a lease contract, utility bills, and photos;\n4Ô∏è‚É£ Audit report.\nDifferences‚ö†Ô∏è:\nRenewal requires the company to be established for one year;\nBUD officially does not have a rigid requirement for one year, as long as actual business can be proven.\nRenewal: 3 employees with MPF contribution records;\nBUD: At least 2 employees, and at least 3 months of MPF records, including self-employment.",

Today, I want to share with you what I have been learning recently ‚Äî clarifying account positioning. I painstakingly organized my insights üíÅ.\nFor those of us new to content creation, we may not yet realize how important it is to clarify account positioning. We often see others mentioning this term in their notes. I didn‚Äôt take this issue seriously before either, thinking as long as the content I shared was interesting, it would be fine. But recently, I discovered that my content is very scattered, and my page doesn‚Äôt look cohesive or pleasing. üòÇ\nAfter constantly browsing other excellent accounts, I realized that without clear account positioning, it‚Äôs challenging to attract targeted followers and difficult to create focused notes. The entire page ends up looking chaotic.\nüëâüëâ1.üßêüßê What exactly is account positioning?\nSimply put, it‚Äôs the type of content you want to present to everyone through your account. Pick 3-4 areas at most.\nüëâüëâ2.üßêüßê How to choose your content focus?\n‚úÖ Choose content you are good at and can stick to: Don‚Äôt feel like you can do everything just because others are doing it. Focus on what you‚Äôre good at and can consistently do over the long term, as we need to continuously update our notes.\n‚ùå Don‚Äôt be too indecisive: After seeing various excellent bloggers, you might feel like you can do this and that too, but trying everything ends up making your content scattered. Stick to 3-4 focus points at most.\n‚úÖ Combine your strengths with the parenting niche for additional value: Leverage your strengths and combine them with parenting topics to increase uniqueness. For example, if I have 10 years of experience working in a bank, I can consider being a ‚ÄòFinance-Savvy Mom‚Äô and sharing topics like how to manage XXX amount of money monthly to earn extra income üí∞.\nüëâüëâ3.üßêüßê What kind of content can be created in the parenting niche? I‚Äôve roughly divided it into these types:\n- Parenting experience for infants (0-1 year) \n- Parent-child outdoor activities \n- Confinement period (timing) \n- Moms + weight loss\n- Pregnancy moms (third trimester focus)\n- Moms + wellness\n- Pre-pregnancy preparation \n- Female self-growth \n- Parenting experience for toddlers (1-3 years) \n- Overseas moms \n- Children‚Äôs educational toys\n- Parenting + home living \n- Daily life VLOGs \n- Aesthetic baby-photo posts \n- Baby food/children‚Äôs meals \n- Handmade crafts + art education \n- Baby products recommendations \n- Older moms \n- Families with elementary school students (study tools)\n- Moms with twins \n- Children‚Äôs height improvement \n- Sophisticated middle-class moms \n- Digestive health support for toddlers \n- Parenting by fathers \n- Early education games for babies\nüëâüëâ4. Examples of parenting bloggers with clear positioning:\n- TaoTao‚Äôs Mom\n- Starry Night Mommy\n- Two XiaoZhao Babies\n- It‚Äôs TangTang \n- Growing with Qi Mom\n- Sweetie TangTang\n- TongTong‚Äôs Mommy\n- BaiZaoZao\nüòç Ladies, let‚Äôs learn together!

Here are some strategies and techniques to make your fashion copy more appealing and easier to go viral:\n\n1. Define your styleüé®\nEvery blogger has their own unique style. Finding and sticking to your style is key. Is it street cool, elegant and intellectual, or retro and modern? Once defined, reflect this style in your copy so followers can recognize you at a glance.\n\t\n\n2. Tell stories rather than just showcaseüìö\nCombine clothing with stories. Fashion is not just about assembling outfits; it‚Äôs also an expression of attitude and storytelling. Incorporate story elements into your copy, such as dressing suggestions for specific occasions or the inspiration and story behind a piece of clothing.\n\t\n\n3. Create a sense of \"must-have\" desireüî•\nUse copy to ignite the desire to buy, but do it subtly. Emphasize how a specific item can \"upgrade\" the overall look or become a \"lifesaver\" in the wardrobe.\n\t\n\n4. Content with strong interactivityüó£Ô∏è\nQuestion-based titles often resonate, such as: \"What to wear for a weekend date? This look will undoubtedly make you the focus!\" or \"Guess the story behind this piece?\" Such interactive content can stimulate fan engagement and enhance interaction rates.\n\t\n\n5. Leverage trends, holidays, or current eventsüìÖ\nKeep up with the times by integrating trending events or holiday elements into your fashion copy, such as: \"Are you ready for these trendy items for the National Day holiday trip?\"\n\t\n\n6. Show individuality and differentiationüåü\nExpress your unique insights and personality in fashion trends through your copy. This not only showcases your expertise but also makes people remember your distinctive taste.\n\t\n\n7. Use emphasis and contrast effectsüëóüÜöüëñ\nFor example, through comparison, show different ways to style the same piece or compare items of the same style but at different price points, giving readers more visual and thought-provoking impact.\n\t\n\n8. Use light and humorous languageü§£\nPeople like lighthearted things, including humorous copy. Add a bit of humor to your writing, allowing for a joyful mood while appreciating beautiful outfits.\n\t\n\nSample Copy:\nüíÉüî• \"Today‚Äôs fashion secret: How to use a scarf to elevate your fall and winter sophistication? Fashion newbies can easily master these tricks, all included here!\"\n\n      \n\nRemember, good fashion copy can immediately create a vivid dressing scenario in the reader‚Äôs mind, making people not only see the clothes but also feel the confidence and style.\n\t\nMaster these key points, and your fashion copy will no longer be dull but full of charm, effortlessly going viral!üë†üíº",

The guy seemed quite attentive, rushing to arrive on time, but his mother lagged behind indifferently. The male guest's mother had just retired from the neighborhood committee, giving the first impression of being difficult to get along with.\nThe biggest drawback of Male Guest No. 3 is also his height, estimated conservatively at less than 170 cm, appearing a bit frail.\nLater, Male Guest No. 3 drove, and after consulting my opinion, he still took me to a remote mall filled mostly with bankrupt internal shops (friends later speculated it was because the parking fee was cheap, only costing 5 yuan [doge]).\nAfter parking, Male Guest No. 3 took me to Dicos for a cup of 8-yuan lemon tea (of course, beverages have no rank, but I have to say, this guy really doesn‚Äôt care about class [laughing face R]).\nDuring the conversation, I learned that Male Guest No. 3 has a mature personality, and his hobbies revolved around flowers, birds, fish, bugs, rural countryside, and other interests.\n\t\nThe second meeting was at a flower and bird market near my home during an evening walk. Just strolling aimlessly in the dark, chatting about flower varieties and the models of mechanical guns that he liked...\nOn a subsequent weekend, he invited me to Chongming Island for an outdoor adventure. I declined. He then suggested going to Dishui Lake. Feeling embarrassed to decline again, I agreed, which led to the Dishui Lake trip [smiling face R].\n\t\nIn early June, with temperatures between 25¬∞C and 30¬∞C, we drove for about two hours to reach Dishui Lake. During the journey, he even took a wrong turn, almost heading outside Lingang, which was quite alarming. After arriving, due to parking difficulties, we drove around and around. (Male Guest No. 3 surely has a strong preference for date spots with fresh outdoor air [teary-eyed laughing face R])\nLater, we walked around Dishui Lake in nearly 30¬∞C heat, making round after round...\nFinally, we drove to a beach near Lingang. Male Guest No. 3 was very eager to explore the beach, which seemed to be the main purpose of his visit.\nHowever, to reach the beach, we had to queue and pass through a fence hole, only to face a ground of sand and mud. I was wearing a dress that day! [disappointed face R][embarrassed face R][frustrated face R]\nBut seeing Male Guest No. 3‚Äôs hopeful eyes, I suggested he go ahead while I waited. He gave up instead.\nThat whole afternoon, I didn‚Äôt even have a sip of water. On the way back, he finally asked if we should get some water, so we stopped at a gas station. Eventually, I volunteered to get off and buy water, quenching my thirst...\nOn the way back, we barely spoke, the sky gradually darkened, and it was almost 8 PM when I got home.\n\t\nThe next day, I told him on WeChat that due to the age gap, it wouldn‚Äôt work out between us.\nThus, the waterless Dishui Lake trip remains an embarrassing memory I‚Äôd rather not revisit to this day‚Ä¶",

As a mother, I felt truly anxious watching this. After countless attempts and trials by consulting resources, I finally found an effective method in half a month. Now we can sleep peacefully.\n‚ÄºÔ∏è Adjust feeding ü§± posture ‚ûï feeding habits ‚ûï control feeding time (control the feeding amount)\nPosture adjustment: I changed from lying down to sitting up for feeding. (Every time I used to feed lying down, my baby would vomit milk)\nAt first, sitting up was a bit hard on my back, but I found the most suitable chair and posture. Now it feels much easier, and I don't worry about milk vomiting anymore.\nFeeding habit changes: Instead of letting him eat to fullness in one go, I let him rest a few minutes in between. Controlled timing:\nI feed for 10 minutes, then let him lie on my chest for a while (about 3 minutes in the posture shown in the picture), then continue feeding for another 10 minutes, and then let him lie on my chest again for a while (about 5 minutes in the posture shown in the picture). I don't burp him because the last time I tried it, he'd vomit milk, so I stopped.\n‚ÄºÔ∏è Once the time is up, I stop feeding... As for formula, I dare not add too much. I increase it slowly, so I only got up to 100ml by day 42.",

There was a young lady who was truly outstanding, especially in fund management! She received endless praise, and after listening, I also felt enlightened. I immediately came back to organize it and share it with my sisters~\n\n-\n\nFund management is divided into three levels: fund diary account, fund flow statement, and fund analysis and budget.\n\n-\n\nüíé‚ë† Basic fund management refers to the diary account, which is essentially the work of a cashier. They are responsible for payment and receipt and recording the diary account.\n\n-\n\nüíé‚ë° The next level is the fund flow statement. Its prototype is the cash flow statement we report to the tax authorities, but many bosses can't understand it. Therefore, financial personnel can reorganize the table according to the boss's requirements, also known as the manager's cash flow statement. The table is used to inform the boss about what is received and where the funds are spent each month.\n\n-\n\nüíé‚ë¢ The third level is fund budgeting, which aims to identify funding gaps.\n\n-\n\nFinance cooperates with the business to predict the next month's or a quarter's income and expenditure:\n\n¬∑ Receipts: Beginning receivables and how much is collected during the current period; current sales and how much is collected in cash; how many advance payments are received.\n\n¬∑ Payments: Beginning payables and how much is paid during the current period; current procurement and how much is foregone in cash payments; how many advance payments are made. Additionally, the current period's expense outlays need to be summarized, including office expenses, business hospitality expenses, wages, rents, etc.\n\n-\n\nOf course, the above pertains to the receipts and payments of working capital. Investment outlays, loan repayments, and other fund inflows and outflows beyond working capital should also be considered.\n\n-\n\nA comprehensive calculation determines the fund balance for the corresponding period, adds the beginning fund balance, and derives the ending fund balance. If the ending balance is negative, it indicates a funding gap.\n\n-\n\nAfter mastering this, you can discuss topics with your boss during small meetings~ Since we are on the subject, many recent graduates have been asking, or feel troubled while job hunting, or feel lost after starting a new job. Taking this opportunity, I‚Äôd like to share some tips on improving our personal skills with my sisters~\n\n¬∑\n\nüçÄ„ÄêTools for Improving Personal Skills„Äë\n\n¬∑\n\nJiatu Accounting: The practical training real-account system is super useful.

They usually have a carefree attitude, thinking their health issues are just slightly high blood sugar, slightly high blood pressure, a kidney stone, and a herniated disc. They don't acknowledge your indication of LDL-c<1 and triglycerides >2 as signs of high cholesterol and lipids, nor do they heed your warning about C-reactive protein being double the critical level indicating body inflammation, or the advice to avoid chicken, duck, beef, and lamb before surgery. When asked to share photos of meals as a group check-in, they comply when in the mood, but when there's no photo, it means they've gone for a seafood feast instead. This results in a month-long effort to reduce blood sugar from 11 down to 5 being undone overnight, shooting back to 9. Some time ago, they experienced abdominal colic, were hospitalized for a few days, and released after some IV fluids. With such a condition of high blood pressure, blood sugar, and lipids, any illness becomes hard to treat. Considering their complaints of chest blockage during meals and poor digestion, along with observing mild diagonal ear lobe creases, I suspect issues like arteriosclerosis or blockages. Despite constant reminders to pay attention to diet, they just won‚Äôt listen, indulging recklessly. It‚Äôs truly heartbreaking and exhausting, feeling like caring deeply all the time only to worry even more during illnesses. Since childhood, I've been independent, hardly troubling my parents with education matters, being highly self-aware. Whenever health issues arose, I'd go to the hospital myself countless times. Faced with emotional difficulties, I wouldn't share anything to avoid causing my parents concern. Such a stark contrast‚Äîit really makes me wonder if I was adopted.

The cold and rebellious young master Wen Yi treated it with indifference, intending to escape again.\nThe old man violently dragged him to a storytelling venue. Wen Yi guessed it was for matchmaking, so he was critical of everything.\nGrandfather: \"The environment here is great. I often come for tea and chats.\" Wen Yi, with an expressionless face: \"Other than tea, there‚Äôs nothing interesting.\" As the sound of string music began, he lazily lifted his eyes.\nOn stage was Gu Shuyun, clad in a smoky hued cheongsam, with light makeup and eyebrows as cool as a cloud painting. Her soft Wu dialect accompanied the pipa's melody in a gentle, shallow chant, like fine raindrops falling ethereally over misty riverbanks in the moonlit Jiangnan.\nThis unreasonable rain in Jiangnan drenched him.\nWho would have thought that after that day, his grandfather stopped mentioning the engagement and even began introducing new matchmaking prospects. Grandfather, calmly sipping tea, said, \"An engagement is just verbal; it can be canceled.\"\nWen Yi crossed his long legs and said plainly, \"Grandfather, one must be trustworthy.\"\n\"Oh, you're suddenly willing now?\" Grandfather deliberately paused, \"But now, the other side may not agree. If you like, you have to work for it yourself.\" Wen Yi let out a nonchalant laugh, \"Then, Grandfather, will you teach me?\"\n-\nWen Yi's friends, hearing that he finally returned to Jingbei, specially sent a car to pick him up as soon as he landed. But throughout the evening, he seemed distracted, his eyelids drooping in a lazy, tired manner.\nFriend: \"What's up? Don't tell me you're adjusting to jet lag; it's just a two-hour flight from Sucheng.\"\nWen Yi, in a low voice, \"I want to go home to accompany my wife.\"\nFriend, shocked: \"Accompany... what now?\"\nAfter saying this, Wen Yi stood up straight and left without any hesitation.\nHowever, a few minutes later, he pushed the door open and returned.\nFriend sneered: \"No need for such an excuse to go out for a cigarette.\"\nWen Yi slightly raised his brows: \"Sorry, I left my marriage certificate here.\"\nFriend: !!! Bro, were you serious?\nI mean, who absurdly carries their marriage certificate around!\n-\nGu Shuyun's life had been orderly and smooth, but at the age of 23, it became tumultuous and chaotic.\nUntil someone boldly and straightforwardly told her‚ÄîPlease allow me to step into your world.\nThe sudden heartbeat was like the fireworks blooming that night.\nThe intense feeling of being loved made her start looking forward to marriage as well.\nHowever, on their wedding night, she somewhat regretted it.\nLater, when a friend asked if she was dissatisfied with her marriage.\nGu Shuyun replied in a small voice. But the friend's loud repetition reached his ears: \"Discontent? And more than once?\" Immediately, Wen Yi's expression changed several times.\nAt night, he ran various trials to inquire...\nGu Shuyun tugged the quilt: \"You said three, no more...\"",

The reason was that she didn't want to see me having a cup of coffee every morning.\n\t\n\"Drinking too much coffee is not good for your health.\"\n\t\nAlthough I wanted to tell her to sleep a bit longer and handle breakfast myself, I couldn't resist her stubborn gaze.\n\t\nIt seemed that if I didn't agree, she would sulk the next moment.\n\t\nSo this morning, when I got up, I was greeted with a warm cup of milk and a sandwich she prepared herself.\n\t\nI took a sip of the milk. Unlike coffee, it was sweet. Putting down the cup, I saw her expectant eyes. She hadn't even touched her own breakfast.\n\t\nI smiled and said, \"It's delicious. I really like it. Thank you for preparing this breakfast for me, my lady.\"\n\t\nShe pretended to respond nonchalantly that it was just okay, average. But I already noticed a few strands of her hair, curled from sleeping, swaying with her cheerful mood.\n\t\nBefore this, I wasn't sure if I liked sweet dairy products like milk.\n\t\nBut just now, I confirmed‚ÄîI do.\n\t\n2\nWith summer vacation approaching, many tasks at the company were wrapping up.\n\t\nThe young lady's design team was no exception. Every time I passed by, it was a scene bustling with people.\n\t\nI saw her leading her team in an orderly manner to push the work forward.\n\t\nWhile feeling relieved, there was also a trace of pride. My young lady had grown to be independent and self-reliant. She no longer needed to hide under my wings; she's an adult now.\n\t\nBut I was also worried. If I no longer provided these opportunities, what would she rely on to love me?\n\t\nShe told me earlier that her team was busy today, so she couldn't join me for lunch.\n\t\nI texted her to remind her to rest, but I couldn't let it go. Leaving my office, I headed directly to her workstation.\n\t\nFrom afar, I saw a little bunny curled up, napping on the desk.\n\t\nI quietly walked over, draped the jacket that had slipped off her shoulders back onto her, and noticing her bunny-shaped mug was empty, I went to the pantry to refill it.\n\t\nWhen I returned, I unintentionally glanced at a corner of her desk filled with sticky notes of various sizes, listing her to-do tasks.\n\t\nThe most prominent one, right in the center, read:\n\t\n\"Buy Sonder's new bunny toy with Lu Chen tonight.\"\n\t\nFor some reason, despite it being an ordinary sentence, I stared at it for a long time.\n\t\nI thought, perhaps the earlier question already had an answer.\n\t\nBefore leaving, I left a new sticky note beside her mug, reminding her the tea was freshly boiled and to be careful not to get burned.\n\t\nThe young lady loves me not just for what I can give her but because it's me, Lu Chen, who gives it. Whether it's as big as the company or as small as daily life matters, the one she loves has always been me.\n\t\nRegarding the issues of love and guilt, she and I have debated before, but this moment's tangible answer was far more convincing.\n\t\n  \n(Further illustrated in the picture",

        "content": "Note Title: nan\n    Note Content: There's a saying: \"What's inside is reflected outside.\" Eczema on the skin is actually a signal from your body that there's something wrong with your constitution, which is why these symptoms appear.\n/\nTraditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has always approached eczema with internal and external treatments, addressing both the root and symptoms. Only by adjusting the constitution and resolving the underlying issues can the problem be truly cured.\n/\nI remember a child who began experiencing intermittent eczema after a fever treatment with intravenous drips. However, the parents, following the advice of Western medicine, continuously applied topical steroid creams to the child.\n/\nLater, they found that the more they applied the creams, the more they needed, but the child's eczema didn't improve much. Moreover, long-term use of steroid creams left the child's skin rough, discolored, and darkened. Upon consulting again, the Western doctors simply said: \"Eczema can't be cured; we can only prescribe some anti-allergy medicine and advise continuing the steroid application.\"\n/\nEventually, they tried TCM. After diagnosis, it was found that the child had weak spleen and stomach, poor digestion with heavy dampness. The internal dampness couldn't be expelled, and the skin, as the largest excretory organ, manifested the eczema. Furthermore, the child had a constitution of blood heat, which generates wind.\n/\nThe approach used included Erchen Tang, roasted coix seed, and white hyacinth bean to remove dampness; Bupleurum and Scutellaria to soothe the liver; cicada shell and Schizonepeta to dispel wind; Lycium root bark, Moutan bark, red peony root, and raw Rehmannia to cool the blood; Angelica and Spatholobus to nourish the blood.\nLater, as blood heat reduced, dampness disappeared, wind and itch were eliminated, and eczema naturally resolved.\n/\nAnother case involved a girl who experienced severe eczema during summer. She tried many medicines, both Western and Chinese, but with no improvement. It was found that every time she sweated and then went into an air-conditioned room, her eczema would flare up the next day.\n/\nThis phenomenon illustrates blocked damp-heat at the pores, essentially stifling the body's natural outlets for damp-heat. The suppression led to the eczema outbreak. Opening the lungs and resolving the exterior to open the pores, releasing dampness and heat, is key to curing this.\n/\nI noticed a higher prevalence of eczema in city dwellers, especially female white-collar workers, compared to rural areas. During summer, pores open to allow heat and damp elimination. However, sudden exposure to air conditioning after sweating causes the pores to close, trapping the damp-heat. Combined with poor dietary habits, this leads to chronic eczema.\n/\nIn one case, I used a Mahuang Lianqiao Chixiaodou Tang to open the excretory pathway, resolving the issue.\n/\nWhen treating eczema patients, I always emphasize dietary restrictions, as I've seen numerous cases where failure to avoid certain foods led to recurring eczema.\n/\nEczema patients often have a constitution of blood heat and damp-heat, essentially heat + dampness.\n/\nThis constitution is either inherent or diet-induced, ultimately damaging the spleen and stomach, causing internal damp-heat generation. When combined with the meddling wind pathogen, wind, dampness, and heat intertwine on the skin, resulting in eczema.\n/\nAs the weather gets hotter, the body's qi and blood follow yang energy outward. In summer, yang energy is more superficial. Evil qi stored within from the past autumn and winter is expelled outward along with qi and blood, manifesting on the skin if not properly handled.",

Just a heads-up for Erhai: the wind there is extremely strong üòì If you don't wear a hat, your hair will instantly turn into a bird's nest üòÖ and it will get tangled! The temperature can be very cold! You won't dare to wear a skirt again, it's unbearable! Luckily, I had a sun-protective top on! For those planning to visit Erhai, remember, avoid bringing skirts! If you are going to Erhai, it's better to wear pants. If you really like wearing skirts, it's best to bring leggings or over-the-knee socks.\nAnyway, I learned my lesson the hard way with skirts~ Everyone, avoid this mistake ü§ó\nüö´ Here are some tips I summarized from this trip üëåüèª\n‚úÖ For photo shoots, Lijiang has a better vibe compared to Dali, and the prices are quite affordable with various styles.\n‚úÖ Don't trust overly-hyped online restaurants too much. On my first day, I went in without much research after a lot of sightseeing, and the restaurant I randomly picked had very average food that wasn't cheap either.\n‚úÖ Avoid renting electric bikes in Dali as their stability isn't good, and distances between places like Dali Ancient Town and Shuanglang are far. Electric bikes can lead to fatigue driving, and roads may not permit them. I saw two or three accidents, all due to electric bikes.\n‚úÖ If you're going to Shangri-La, stay there for at least one night. Avoid bathing or washing your hair at night, drink plenty of hot water, keep warm, and use oxygen to reduce altitude sickness.\nüëâüèª Yunnan Cuisine\n‚ù§Ô∏è Food in Dali: Dali clay pot fish, sour and spicy fish, crispy rice, rice noodle rolls, Xizhou baba, three-course tea, Bai ethnic eight bowls\n‚ù§Ô∏è Food in Lijiang: rice sausage, cured pork ribs, butter tea, black goat\n‚ù§Ô∏è Food in Shangri-La: barley wine, barley cake, yak yogurt, spiced liver\n‚ù§Ô∏è As for accommodation, I won't say much since I joined a guided group and hardly had to worry about it. Hygiene and environment were very good. For independent travelers, consider booking hotels in advance!\n‚ù§Ô∏è In Lijiang, it's recommended to stay near the entrance to the ancient town, which is convenient for shopping and carrying luggage.\n‚ù§Ô∏è In Dali, to see the sunset, consider staying in Haidong Shuanglang. To see the sunrise, staying near Dali Ancient Town is more convenient.\nIt was my first time traveling to Yunnan. I did all kinds of research beforehand, and it was really overwhelming!

        "content": "Note Title: AI Glasses Expectedly Boomed, Why Didn't the Mainstream Stocks Quadruple in Value?\n    Note Content: ‚Ä¶Last week, it was suggested that AI glasses would enter a global new product launch peak period in September. Strictly speaking, this is the first AI hardware landing product, so the capital market reacts in advance and gives a sharp increase in stock price. Amid a sluggish market this week, AI glasses gradually became a bright spot as a main line; leading stock Dr. Glasses rose nearly 4 times from the bottom. Today, taking this case as an example to popularize the core framework system of investment:\n‚Ä¶1. ‚ÄúDo you know or not‚Äù: When an opportunity comes, do you have the corresponding knowledge system? It is often said that your wealth is the realization of your cognition (yours + others). You cannot earn money beyond your understanding, and this can be achieved through efforts.\n‚Ä¶2. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs the one‚Äù: Based on the basic knowledge mastered in point 1, when facing opportunities, it is essentially about extracting a part (the result being the selected stock) from the foundational knowledge to respond to the opportunity. In the capital market, correct responses lead to profit; incorrect ones lead to loss. This level requires systematic abstract capabilities and is relatively challenging.\n‚Ä¶3. ‚ÄúCan you hold onto it?‚Äù Holding a stock is like staying loyal! With cognition and accurate interpretation, after purchasing, your emotions fluctuate with stock price changes‚Äîdoubting points 1 & 2 or oscillating between them, leading to repetitive trading and inability to hold on. Selling a stock only to see its price soar afterward. This is where successful investors grow through continuous experience to achieve a calm and mature mindset, which is highly difficult.\n‚Ä¶The methodology of friendships and marriages is similar. Only by fully understanding your candidates can you comprehensively assess and make a choice after thorough weighing. After establishing a friendship or marital relationship, it‚Äôs years or decades of ‚Äústock-holding,‚Äù inevitably involving ups and downs, temptations, illnesses, and so on. Do you see it later as ‚Äúa timely cut-off now but regretful later,‚Äù or ‚Äúa firm belief in cognition and unified action, ultimately achieving great success‚Äù? \n‚Ä¶Finally, back to the question in the title: Why didn't the stocks favored by fund companies in Image 1 rise but instead those 'unrefined' companies like 'Dr. Glasses' surged? Because in a continuously shrinking market, fund companies must cope with investor redemptions by selling high-profile stocks continuously. Thus, less prominent stocks became the unanimous focus of active market funds.",

During the start of the freshman year last year, I was assigned to the current dormitory and met my current roommate, who is the protagonist I want to talk about, Problem Sister. At first, I wasn't very familiar with her. Our dormitory houses eight people, and I got to know her better during military training. Gradually, we became close. She had trouble waking up in the morning, and our school requires morning self-study, so I would call her to wake up every day. Over time, we became closer, eating meals together and attending classes together. Initially, I was happy to have a regular meal buddy in college, but slowly, Problem Sister's issues began to surface. At first, she would frequently pull my chair during class to make our chairs stick together. She also liked pinching my legs, holding my hand, and sometimes even lifting my legs to place them on her feet. She insisted on holding onto me while walking, pressing half of her body against mine. This wasn't even the most excessive part; she loved pinching or slapping my buttocks, which sometimes really upset me, though it was hard to confront her about it. Occasionally, she would randomly treat me to meals. On weekends, we would go out to eat and play, and she rarely asked me for money. When we traveled together previously, she didn't ask me for money either, and I just tagged along, feeling like a puppet. I tried transferring money to her out of guilt, but she wouldn't accept it. On certain holidays, she would give me some random gifts or buy double of whatever she was getting to give me one, though they weren't particularly valuable things, like earrings, hair clips, clothes, or dresses. I thought of buying her something in return, but she seems to have everything she needs. Problem Sister is really puzzling. Every day, she asks questions like, 'Do you love me? Will you remember me after you graduate? Will you miss me in the future?' She repeatedly asks such things, and it's frustrating to answer all the time. I've been considering whether I should continue being friends with her. It feels like there's no real meaning in hanging out with her, but directly telling her seems a bit harsh. Is there any way to subtly express that I don't particularly want to continue being her friend?",

Today, the teacher will analyze this for everyoneÔΩû\n\nImpact on Adult Education Undergraduate Students\nThe core of the Degree Law lies in standardizing the degree awarding process, protecting the rights of applicants, ensuring the smooth implementation of the degree system, and thus promoting the development of education, culture, and science and technology. Overall, the application for degrees will become stricter.\nSignificance of the Degree Law for Adult Education\nRegarding the application for a bachelor's degree, regardless of the way the degree is obtained, including open education, self-taught bachelor's degree courses, and adult college entrance examinations, students must complete the study of general courses and major courses and meet certain score requirements, with special emphasis on the quality of theses.\nThe impact on adult education students can be summarized into four points:\n[RainbowR]1. Degree Awarding Standards Are Stricter\nAfter the reform of the Degree Law, the standards for awarding degrees will become stricter. This means that during the study process, more requirements will need to be met to successfully obtain a degree.\n[RainbowR]2. Degree Certification Procedure Will Be More Standardized\nTo prevent fraudulent degrees, the degree certification procedure will be more standardized. This will further enhance the value of the degree and lay a solid foundation for future career development.\n[RainbowR]3. Degree Management System Will Be More Improved\nThe reform of the Degree Law also involves the improvement of the degree management system. Schools will provide more comprehensive and detailed teaching to ensure that the knowledge students acquire is of higher quality and their learning process is smoother.\n[RainbowR]4. Academic Integrity Requirements\nUnder the new Degree Law, academic integrity will become a principle that everyone must strictly adhere to. Any form of academic misconduct will be severely punished, upholding the bottom line of integrity.\nIn general, there will be stricter requirements for degree applications in the future. If you are still hesitating about whether to pursue further education, it's time to act fast~\n[StudentR][StudentR][StudentR][StudentR]Ways to Improve Education Levels [StudentR][StudentR][StudentR][StudentR]\n[FireR]Adult College Entrance Examination\nRequires prior education qualifications, and it is necessary to pass the entrance examination, which is a national unified admission exam. Only after being admitted can you start studying.\nObtaining a degree is relatively simple in this scenario. Some institutions do not require English for obtaining a degree, and passing the thesis is sufficient, with a unified academic system of 2.5 years.",

Today, I'll share with you what you should prepare for a trip to Yunnan, along with some practical travel tips:\nFirst, let's talk about Dali. The wind there is just unbelievable! I wanted to go out looking beautiful and take some stunning photos, but the wind completely ruined my image‚ÄîI could hardly stand still! It gets so cold when the wind blows. So, dear sisters visiting Erhai Lake, be sure to bring a jacket. The weather changes unpredictably, and you won't see it coming! I was lucky enough to bring a sun-protective shirt, which saved me from freezing.\n.\n‚ö† Suggested Tips:\n1Ô∏è‚É£ Do bring a jacket to Yunnan. The temperature difference between day and night is significant, and in summer, if it rains, the temperature can drop rapidly.\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Don‚Äôt always book accommodations in the same place. Tourist spots in Yunnan are quite spread out, so it's more convenient to stay wherever you're playing.\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Don‚Äôt wait until you arrive to book hotels, especially during peak tourist seasons‚Äîlast-minute bookings can lead to prices skyrocketing.\n4Ô∏è‚É£ Don‚Äôt trust free entry pathways for scenic spots. All ticket-required attractions don‚Äôt have free entry‚Äîtickets must be purchased through official channels.\n5Ô∏è‚É£ Don‚Äôt forget to bring mosquito repellent. In summer, most areas in Yunnan have many mosquitoes, and they can be quite vicious.\n6Ô∏è‚É£ Do avoid taking black market taxis near airports or train stations. These cars lack security measures and may charge exorbitant prices.\n.\nüíó Things to Do When Visiting Yunnan:\n1Ô∏è‚É£ You really don‚Äôt need to bring too many clothes to Yunnan right now. Just bring a thick jacket for sun protection and for morning and evening use. There are many beautiful dresses available in Dali Old Town for about 70 yuan, along with matching accessories and bags.\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Coca-Cola is very effective in alleviating altitude sickness. If you feel really uncomfortable, go get some oxygen‚Äîit works remarkably well!\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Try to avoid wearing ethnic shawls! Avoid wearing ethnic shawls! Avoid wearing ethnic shawls! It‚Äôs worth saying three times: you‚Äôll likely be identified as a tourist and could easily get scammed.\n-\nI won‚Äôt say much about accommodations since I joined a group tour and barely had to worry about it‚Äîthe hygiene and environment were great. For those traveling independently, I recommend booking hotels in advance. If you‚Äôre planning to visit multiple cities in Yunnan, managing the transportation can be tricky. If it‚Äôs your first time visiting Yunnan, I suggest joining a reliable local tour group. Look for one that includes transportation, meals, accommodations, and entry tickets to make things easier. I used @GuoCaiTravel and found their packages relaxing and enjoyable. Wishing you a happy trip to Yunnan!\n.",

        "content": "Note Title: After a Friend's Civil Service Exam Failure, My Fear of Exams Reached its Peak\n    Note Content: Hearing about a friend's failure in the civil service exam interview, my fear of exams reached its peak.\nFrom elementary school all the way to university, exams of all sizes and levels. I kept repeating the social stereotype of 'failure,' continually taking exams, occasionally succeeding. Occasionally, or rarely. Under the influence of this traditional model and my family's constant emphasis, the phrase 'effort will lead to rewards' became deeply rooted in my heart, and to this day, I still can't fully escape it. I don't know how to describe the phrase 'effort will lead to rewards'; to me, it is utterly absurd because you can always attribute failure to not trying hard enough. Always. I can't apply this statement to my friend; indeed, she did not gain what she wanted to gain.\n\t\nAfter failing the postgraduate entrance exam, I developed a profound fear of it. Yet at that moment, I still harbored a bizarre naivety, thinking that perhaps civil service exams would yield rewards as long as you contributed enough. When the resumes I sent daily received no responses or responses that were either unexpected or unfavorable, I couldn't help but open the civil service exam app and skillfully chose the path of exams. But today, that naivety was utterly shattered. What if I never succeed in any of these exams? Parents always say, 'Look, that person finally passed after several years of attempts.' We focus on the cheers of those who succeed and ignore the silence of those who fail. Yes, she/he finally passed. Finally!\n\t\nI can't even comfort my friend; I always feel that anything I say would sound pale and powerless. In the most painful and tormenting period during my postgraduate exam prep, I told myself, 'It's okay once you get through it.' But after moving on, I found that I was still deeply trapped. This afternoon, I attended an interview; a once highly desirable big enterprise offered only an internship salary of 1,500 and said that's all there is. People always say there are 'vast wildernesses' in life. But when I took my bachelor's degree and ventured outward, finding that most job choices were still in sales, and when I reluctantly accepted the idea of doing sales but heard of such a ridiculous salary, I genuinely wanted to ask the so-called wilderness, 'Hey, where are you?'\n\t\nI hate the nonchalant phrase, 'College students should remove the long gown of Kong Yiji.' Who can absolve themselves from weaving that clothing? I cannot respond to the elders' question of why it's so hard for a college graduate to find a job earning over 4,000.

Contact the nurses' station, ask for an obstetrician to perform a discharge evaluation, and request the doctor to help fill out the mother and baby health handbook. Once the doctor confirms, you can start packing your belongings.\n2. Apply for the birth certificate. Check if the hospital has already recorded the baby‚Äôs birth information in the system. Parents can only apply for the birth medical certificate after the information is entered.\n3. The hospital will provide three tannic acid ointments, one bottle of 75% alcohol, and Vitamin AD. Check if you have received them.\n4. If the family rented a bed, remember to call at least three hours in advance to retrieve the deposit (with the deposit receipt).\n5. Once your luggage is packed, go to the nurses' station and ask the nurse to wrap the baby.\n6. The nurse will check all the baby‚Äôs examination documents. If they are complete with no issues, you can leave with the baby and gifts. Remember to use your ID to collect the registration slips for the 42-day postpartum check-up for the mother and baby from the self-service machine when discharging.\n\t\n\nPrecautions\n‚Üí There are more doctors and nurses in the obstetrics ward of Peking University Third Hospital, not one-on-one service, so you must double-check everything yourself before discharging. You can also ask the caregiver aunties, as they are very familiar with relevant procedures and formalities.\nVarious Cost Settlements\n1. Meal card refunds can be done directly through the \"Peking University Third Hospital Service Account.\"\n2. Hospitalization cost settlements can either be applied for home delivery online or settled offline five working days later. You need to bring the hospitalization deposit receipt to the hospitalization department for processing, and complete the cost settlement depending on medical insurance reimbursement requirements to obtain relevant receipts.\n3. Medical record copies can also be applied for on the \"Peking University Third Hospital Service Account\" and sent directly to your home.\n4. For paid but unused examinations and registrations, refunds need to be processed at the hospital's manual counter. For each examination, you need to have a doctor in the consultation room confirm first, and then handle the refund at the manual counter.",

Seeing 'mothers' in the comment section calling their names and enthusiastically recommending them was fascinating. They could precisely identify each panda and remember their names. That was it. I just watched them foolishly as a refreshing part of my ordinary life, and they brought me a lot of healing. I gradually and intermittently fell for these pandas, but even so, in my mind, they collectively existed as giant pandas in a shared identity.\nUntil this year, I was captivated by Huahua's videos. Watching many videos in one go, maybe because I've grown older, I took the initiative this time to get to know them, recognize individual pandas, and memorize their names. I realized each of them is an individual, with unique personalities. Huahua is soft, adorable, clingy, and shy; Ergou is smart, greedy, and sensitive; Aijiu is a solitary baby; and Ye is often inadvertently overlooked because she hangs out with her slow, calm sister. There are so many kids with different traits, such as Shunshun, who is affectionate and slightly tsundere; Rourou, an adorable foodie who loves being praised by humans; or Yaya, who has faced unfortunate circumstances but strives to carry on. I finally understood that these precious pandas also have emotions, personalities, emotional needs, and they can feel joy and pain.\nThere are so many touching moments: Runyue teaching Huahua to climb trees; Rourou feeling sad because tourists left without looking at her; Shunshun stopping her livestream and crying when she thought she'd never see her caretaker again... I truly wish these precious pandas could always be happy.\nTonight, as I continued watching videos, I saw Yuanrun trying hard to befriend her neighbor. It reminded me that she has always been an emotionally rich and sensitive bear. Unfortunately, her life's journey has repeatedly forced her to experience separations: her best friend Miaomiao, her daughter Runyue, and goddaughter Huahua [Crying R]. She is just a little bear that loves companionship [Crying R]. Many fans hope Miaomiao can become her neighbor. I also wish there could be a very tall tree she could climb, allowing her to see all her familiar and unfamiliar companions at the base. Most importantly, to glimpse her beloved daughter Runyue and Huahua [Sakura R].\nI sincerely hope the base and the wider system could look beyond just the physical living conditions of the pandas and also value their emotional needs. I hope they strive to let the pandas reunite with their separated family and friends during their lifetime [Frown R].\nFeeling sentimental at midnight, I typed these words [Pitiful R]",

They usually just code and sometimes watch some small videos, rarely paying attention to their own matters, especially in health and wealth. Although programmers have high incomes, they often fail to maintain their health and wealth, which is undoubtedly a waste of their precious youth. After ten years of coding, they suffer from baldness, cervical spondylosis, lumbar disc herniation, frozen shoulder, wrist inflammation, myopia, stomach problems, losing money in stocks, losing money in funds, and finally being deceived in relationships.\nUndoubtedly, in such cases, Hong Kong insurance is, without a doubt, the best choice for programmers. Critical illness insurance should be purchased early to store long-term funds for their health; savings insurance provides stable growth returns and asset protection, ensuring they won‚Äôt be deceived financially by others anymore.

The scale of the community and surrounding commercial areas will be more lively in the future.\n2: The apartment layout is mainly for improvement. The four-leaf clover layout has little waste, compared to the traditional long hallway which is too wasteful. Every room is so big. The downside is that the dynamic and static areas are not well-separated, as the living and dining areas are together. Of course, I don‚Äôt care since I live alone anyway. Starting from 90 square meters, I looked at 146, then 152, and finally was attracted by the 173 square meter layout. It‚Äôs a corner unit with good sunlight, mid-rise with a private elevator, not crowded.\n3: Now the national housing tax rate is discounted, and the local government provides a 300-per-square-meter housing subsidy, so later taxes and maintenance funds, etc., basically don‚Äôt cost me money.\n4: Most importantly, after being in the building materials and home furnishings industry for more than ten years, I want to decorate an ideal residence as comfortably as possible, such as central air conditioning, floor heating, smart toilet, independent suite, large walk-in closet, bathtub, soundproof windows, etc. I will hire a designer to design it well and share the renovation process.\nEnd",
