The meaning of life; Highlights from \"Be Different Because of You\" | Kai-Fu Lee & Hai-Tao Fan ※ [Star r] This is an autobiography by Kai-Fu Lee, recording his fascinating yet turbulent experiences. It's a book that brings strength to readers. I still remember the excitement and novelty of reading it for the first time, and it continues to inspire me. ※ [Star r] Excerpts of sentences that touched me: ※ 01 In the summer of 1984, Kai-Fu Lee taught computer courses to 60 of Pennsylvania's brightest high school students, carefully preparing for lessons, designing assignments, and thoroughly enjoying the experience. However, students gave him a rating of only 1 point because his classes were too boring. Everyone pursuing a Ph.D. might consider teaching as a career option. Clearly, I wasn’t a good teacher. What should I do? Give up? No. I decided to overcome my bottleneck and weaknesses. I began consulting with renowned professors in the department for teaching skills, worked on gaining public speaking opportunities, conquered my psychological barriers, and strived to be a good communicator. ※ 02 The famous philosopher Pericles once said, Someone who has thoughts but cannot express them is as if they have no thoughts. ※ 03 The author's 80-year-old father, while visiting as a scholar in the U.S., persistently researched modern Chinese history. Each morning, the author would drive his father to East Asian Library at the University of Pittsburgh, picking him up after work, while his father ate simple sandwiches at the library for lunch. On his father's desk beneath the glass plate lay a note with the words \"An old ox understands dusk falls late, and strives without waiting for the whip.\" ※ 04 The criteria for choosing a job are growth, interest, and impact. ※ 05 In life, we must have the courage to change the things we can, the patience to accept the things we cannot change, and the wisdom to distinguish between the two. ※ 06 A quote from \"Walden\": I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. ※ 07 Do not blindly follow others; do not be misled by doctrines. Only your inner self knows who you truly want to be, and only you can find your own value. ※ 08 Success has no absolute definition. Success is being the best version of yourself and presenting that version to the world. ※ #TheMeaningOfLife[Topic]# #ReadingNotes[Topic]# #Biographies[Topic]# #BookNotes[Topic]# #BookExcerpt[Topic]# #MyPersonalReadingList[Topic]# #SelfGrowth[Topic]# #MarkMyLife[Topic]#\n```",

This might not count as a pitfall, but the taxi and food prices are on par with Beijing. #QuanzhouTravel[topic]# #Quanzhou[topic]# ※ 5. If you want to take 'Peranakan' style photos, head to Wulin.

Later, I discovered it also works well with Chanel Hydra Beauty Essence Water.\n※ Many people say it’s overrated, but I really like it. This is the second bottle. Secondary Cleansing Water is not just a myth. This water doesn’t show significant effects when used for wet compress or single application, nor does it maintain skin stability or provide hydration. The best use I’ve found is to moisten a cotton pad and wipe counterclockwise on the face. You can always see yellow residue or leftover makeup being removed. It’s especially great for oily skin. It not only reduces oil secretion but also promotes better absorption of subsequent skincare products. Since it contains no alcohol, it’s also suitable for sensitive skin. #Lamer The Tonic [Hashtag]# la mer\n```",

Hello everyone, I believe many people encounter a question during weight loss: Why does eating so little not lead to weight reduction? Especially during a plateau phase, when eating just a bit less leads to no change in weight the next day? That’s because many people eat so little to lose weight—below the basal metabolism rate—that the body thinks you are in a dangerous state. In order to maintain life, it enters 'protection mode,' reducing consumption to balance with your intake. 2 How to self-check for metabolism damage A super simple self-check method: Weigh yourself first thing in the morning after waking up on an empty stomach compared to your weight from the night before. More than 1.6 pounds difference means your metabolism is strong (you lose weight easily) 0.8-1.6 pounds is normal metabolism Less than 0.8 pounds means metabolism damage!!! 3 Methods to improve metabolism Don’t demonize metabolism damage!!! A reduction in metabolism is entirely normal, possibly due to eating less or weight loss. Many think that a slower metabolism means gaining weight easily. Nonono! There's a certain range of metabolism decline. The reduction isn't so drastic compared to total metabolism. For instance, a metabolism of 1500 doesn’t drop to 700-800, so don’t worry too much. There are other ways to improve. A good mindset leads to better results!  Eat more protein!!! Protein boosts metabolism. I usually eat [...] in the morning to start accelerating metabolism early in the day.  Pair it with milk/soy milk to increase protein intake. Maintain adequate sleep!!! Many believe simply lying in bed without physical movement is bad for weight loss. However, sufficient sleep greatly increases the rate of weight loss! On one hand, staying up late disrupts metabolism, while sleep promotes the secretion of a substance that controls appetite. On the other hand, it also consumes a large amount of calories. A good night’s sleep makes weight loss efforts more productive! Drink more water, tea, or black coffee!!! Our body needs a lot of water during calorie consumption. Insufficient water intake reduces calorie burning, leading to reduced metabolism. If you can accept black coffee, it’s a fantastic choice. Some types of coffee can speed up metabolism. Maintain regular three meals!!!!! Eat no less than your basal metabolic rate each day! My basal metabolism is 1200 calories, and with all activities like walking to class, my daily metabolism is around 1700-1800 calories. Even if I eat 1200 calories, there’s an energy deficit and I will lose weight! Next, I will check in with everyone and share daily meals for the 105-95 pound stage. What would you like to see next: How I overcame two plateau phases from 120 to 105? How did I shift my weight-loss mindset to focus on pleasing myself? How to increase water intake unconsciously during weight loss? Tips to curb food cravings? How to make food more filling?\n```",

Part One (Chapters 1-2): Introduction to Accounting Concepts and Basics, Memorize the Six Elements First! The major accounting table in the textbook, including asset, liability, and income categories, needs to be memorized. Follow the summary by the teacher: 'Two receipts, two achievements, income tax, three expenses, three benefits, plus deduction' mnemonic to memorize it! If you don’t understand, search it until you get it. ※ 2. Part Two (Chapters 3-7 & 9): The high-scoring chapters are all here. Start with assets; once you finish reading the textbook for this, you’ve covered the basics. Then move on to owner’s equity, liabilities, income, expenses, and profit. Mastering these ensures passing is not an issue. Lastly, focus on the newly added Chapter 9 about product cost accounting. ※ 3. Part Three (Chapters 8 & 9): Covers the three main financial reports and the newly added basics of government accounting. ※ - ※ Economic Law ※ Legal Basics + Tax Laws (Four Major Taxes & Minor Taxes) + Other Laws (Labor Contracts & Negotiable Instruments Law) ※ 1. Part One (Chapter 1): Basics of law, mainly for foundational understanding of subsequent topics. ※ 2. Part Two (Chapters 2-3 & 8): Other laws, where negotiable instruments and labor contracts are relatively significant and require time to memorize. ※ 3. Part Three (Chapters 4-7): Tax laws, mainly the four major taxes (VAT, consumption, corporate, individual) and minor taxes; it’s recommended to start with VAT! This part focuses on understanding and memorizing the scope of taxation, applicable tax rates, tax incentives, and special provisions of various taxes. Use the methods summarized by teachers: cases + mnemonics + keywords + important numbers, which are more efficient than rote memorization! ※ - ※ Study Methods ※ Watching Lectures: Find a teacher with a suitable style to listen to. Even if some exam points are forgotten later, logical reasoning through what you’ve learned helps. I watched Zhong Ziqi at the time and plan to continue with him for CPA. His classes are concise, and he facilitates solving problems during lectures—it’s very convenient. During the sprint phase, I also watched some of Xie Mingfen’s classes, which seem excellent for learning techniques! ※ Practicing: Initially, I solved exercises chapter by chapter after lectures. During the mid-phase, I focused on topic-specific practice. I started with printed question banks like the ‘Must-Do 550 Questions.’ Later, I practiced online, focusing on Zhong Zhong’s weekly basic assessments and core 100 questions, as well as question banks from Zhile Wang. In the end, I simulated exams on the computer for a week, which felt very smooth! ※ Schedule: 5+1+1 study method—no need to elaborate, it’s highly efficient, and I recommend it to everyone. ※ #IntroductoryAccounting [Topic]# #IntroductoryAccountingExam [Topic]# #IntroductoryAccountingPreparation [Topic]# #24IntroductoryAccounting [Topic]# #AccountingGirls [Topic]#\n```",

At a dinner party, someone teased: Mr. Wen became famous young and is exceptionally talented. Why, even a genius calligrapher has bored you? Shen Yan didn't even lift his eyes and replied: A block of wood, rigid and dull, boring as hell. Shen Yan's arrogance was all seen by Wen Yan. Stop joking; isn't this fine the way it is? Pretty Wife, Come Hook Me Up Ji Zhiyuan, aloof, arrogant, unapproachable, even with wealth and handsomeness, no one dared casually approach him. On a rainy night, Wen Yan, with reddened eyes, knocked on Ji Zhiyuan's door: Do you want to embarrass Shen Yan? Aloof Ji Zhiyuan: Of course. Wen Yan: Then marry me. Unapproachable Ji Zhiyuan: Okay. That's... too quick an agreement, Wen Yan hadn't even squeezed out tears yet. Shen Yan, realizing things too late, learned Wen Yan wanted to get married but never mentioned it was with him. He never thought he would lose so miserably. Just as Wen Yan never thought he would so effortlessly achieve his wish. From beginning to end, all Wen Yan ever wanted was Ji Zhiyuan. After marriage, he even thought, since it was a forced relationship, he wouldn’t mind if it wasn't sweet. Ji Zhiyuan: Wife, cuddle. Whether others liked it or not, he’d announce: How did you know I got married? That's right, I married Mr. Wen. Pretty Wife, Come Hook Me Up After realizing he was the one tricked, Wen Yan couldn't be bothered maintaining his noble and solemn persona anymore, clinging to the man's waist and acting coy.

Ji Zhiyuan: No more pretending. Ji Zhiyuan stood before a wall full of works, his eyes deepening: Your calligraphy is indeed beautiful. Calligraphy or the person? Wen Yan leaned in. The man glanced sideways, his eyes anything but innocent: Mr. Wen, as the saying goes, the calligraphy reflects its writer. Note: Shen Yan is a scumbag side character, very scummy, not the protagonist, and a playboy. Wen Yan never liked Shen Yan, approaching him only to tactically close the distance with Ji.

However, my understanding is limited to apartments within the city. ※ 1 Try to choose apartments within the free tram zone, preferably along tram lines. Even going one stop out of the free zone frequently encounters ticket inspections. For example, in Liange Lou, you might run into inspectors 8 out of 10 times. If living there, it's better to get off at Elizabeth St and walk. ※ 2 Choose buildings with more elevators, as waiting time and crowding levels are usually proportional. Of course, also consider the number of units per floor. For example, Swanston Square has too many units, leading to extended waiting times. ※ 3 Pay attention to the floor plans, building exterior, orientation, and street layout (in cases where you can't inspect in person). Some apartment structures can be discerned from the outside, such as fewer windows, long hallways, irregular layouts, limited usable space, or buildings being too close to each other, like Melbourne Sky. ※ 4 Be sure to check the condition of the walls when viewing. Leases are typically six months to a year, and if wall damage happens during your stay, you might have to pay for repairs when returning the property. For example, 39 Caravel Ln in Docklands. ※ 5 Orientation is crucial. I've lived in west-facing, north-facing, south-facing, and dark apartments. South-facing is the shadow side and incredibly hard to endure in winter—clothes won't dry, and there's no sunlight all year round. North-facing is ideal, but it can get too hot in summer. ※ 6 Cleaning upon moving out here requires very high standards, unlike in some other countries. When signing the lease, carefully review the condition report. Any issues not marked by the agent should be reported immediately; otherwise, you might be blamed for them later. ※ 7 During your stay, if anything stops working, let the agent know. For example, if the light breaks or the lock is damaged, these are the landlord's responsibilities. Agents will send someone to fix them. ※ A small tip is that paying cash for cleaning can sometimes get you discounts. ※ #MelbourneCityRenting[Topic]#\n```",

Can recommend calories based on personal situations and allow customization of calorie gaps ※ 2. Can track diet, calories, as well as carbs, fat, and protein ※ 3. Preferably free to use ※ [Calories] ※ Upon first login, both Mint Health and Shi Ka Ka provide a personal test to recommend calorie intake, and both allow you to modify calorie goals. ※ Mint Health automatically sets a calorie gap based on your situation, so its recommended calorie count is after subtracting the calorie gap. The advantage is that it’s convenient—just follow it blindly. The downside is that you can’t clearly understand your basal metabolism or the exact calorie gap. ※ Shi Ka Ka’s recommended calorie count is just your basal metabolic rate. The advantage is that you know your metabolism clearly and can freely set the calorie gap according to your needs. The downside is that you have to figure out what calorie gap suits you. ※ [Diet Tracking] ※ The calorie estimates for foods in Mint Health and Shi Ka Ka don’t have much difference. Both have comprehensive food databases and support custom food entries for items not found, and they also show carb, fat, and protein intake. ※ PS: I drank an orange-flavored Americano from Luckin Coffee in the morning and was surprised to find it listed on Shi Ka Ka. ※ [Features] ※ Mint Health’s features are very comprehensive. Besides tracking diet, exercise, weight, and measurements, it also tracks water intake, sleep, and many more functions. ※ Shi Ka Ka focuses on diet, exercise, weight, and measurements. It includes a popular 16+8 intermittent fasting mode to help calculate eating and fasting times, which is pretty useful. ※ [User Experience] ※ Mint Health feels very functional and comprehensive, but many features are unnecessary for my needs since I only want to track diet and calories. The excess features might also explain the many small ads on the pages prompting payments, which I dislike. ※ Shi Ka Ka, while simpler in features, focuses on diet, calorie tracking, exercise, and basic measurements. The 16+8 fasting feature is practical to me. It’s free, with no ads cluttering the page, letting me concentrate solely on diet tracking. ※ I personally prefer Shi Ka Ka. ※ [Summary] ※ It depends on individual needs. Choose Shi Ka Ka if you only want to track diet and calories. ※ If you also need dietary guidance or want to record other metrics, choose Mint Health. ※ #AppReview[Tag]# #WeightLoss[Tag]# #DietTracking[Tag]# #Calories[Tag]# #CalorieCounting[Tag]# #ShiKaKa[Tag]# #AppRecommendation[Tag]#\n```",

When I brought the big bag to the hospital, I found I couldn't even use that much. A natural childbirth typically requires just a 2-3 day stay in the hospital. Post-delivery, I reflected and summarized the ultra-simplified delivery kit as follows.\n※   ※ 👩 ※ \n1. Postpartum Clothes ※ I brought two sets thinking I would need a change, but in reality at the hospital, I didn't sweat or get dirty, so I only wore one set. If you sweat or worry about stains, bring an extra set. \n2. Postpartum Shoes ※ Regular back-heel cotton slippers will suffice, no need to buy anything special. \n3. Nursing Pads ※ A pack of 10 is enough; they are used for internal checkups, water breakage, etc. You can buy more from vending machines if needed, and extras can be used at home. \n4. Foldable Basin ※ Nurses will provide foot bath packs to use morning and night until discharge. A foldable basin is convenient and space-saving. \n5. Straw Cup ※ Essential for staying hydrated during labor and post-delivery when sitting up may be inconvenient. A straw cup makes it much easier to drink water while lying down. \n6. Measured Maternity Sanitary Pads ※ Nurses will recommend these after episiotomy. \n7. Sanitary Panties ※ After episiotomy, nurses will require disposable underwear + pads. Sanitary pants are much easier to handle. \n8. Pulp Paper ※ Not needed for labor. After delivery, when the nurse massages to promote lactation, they may use a few sheets as cushions. These are heavy; a small pack is enough. If not prepared, it's okay. You can use them at home for lochia as they are more breathable than pads. \n9. Disposable Underwear ※ Three to four pieces will suffice. Wear one to the hospital; very convenient. \n10. Soft-Bristled Toothbrush + Toothpaste ※ A soft toothbrush is recommended postpartum. \n11. Towel ※ Couldn't get out of bed the whole day due to wounds, so relied on my husband to wipe my face [laughing with tears emoji]. \n12. Hat ※ I think a postpartum hat isn’t needed in the hospital because the room temperature is high. You can wear a baseball cap when leaving the hospital—no need to label yourself like you just gave birth [disappointed emoji]. \n13. Discharge Clothes ※ Prepare weather-appropriate clothes, warmer ones for the discharge day. \n14. T-Bandage ※ Nurses will use this for ice packs on episiotomy wounds; you can buy it from the vending machines outside the ward. \n15. Toilet Seat Covers ※ Disposable ones for the ward's automatic toilets that don’t fit😂. \n※   ※ Documents ※ \n1. ID cards of both spouses \n2. Maternity health insurance card \n3. Last obstetric ultrasound + fetal monitoring results ※ The hospital’s pre-admission checklist stated all prenatal checkup records, but when checking in, they only required the last ultrasound and the day's fetal monitoring report done in the emergency room. \n※   ※ 🌟 Backup ※ \n1. Temperature-controlled Kettle ※ Convenient for preparing formula without worrying about temperature control issues. I didn't bring one, unsure if the hospital allows them; decide according to your situation. \n2. Breast Pump ※ If the baby is taken to the neonatal department, moms can use the breast pump to stimulate milk production and avoid engorgement. ※   ※ #Delivery Kit List [Topic]# Gansu Provincial Maternity and Child LDR Ultra-Simplified Delivery Kit 5.

Driven by emotions, they naturally show true feelings. When he cries in front of you, it is a sign of unconditional trust and love for you. He hopes you can understand and cherish his sincerity. #GenderRelations[Topic]#  #GenderEmotion[Topic]#  #SmartWoman[Topic]#  #FemaleEmotion[Topic]#  #Emotion[Topic]# The deeper a man loves you, the harder it is for him to hide these 3 instinctive reactions Swipe left to read images~. 1. Nervousness Heart racing, speechlessness: When a man deeply loves you, he feels nervous being with you. This nervousness is not due to fear but because he cares about your opinions and feelings. His heartbeat accelerates, and he may even stutter or not know what to say when talking to you. He wants to present himself perfectly in front of you, but the more he cares, the clumsier and more nervous he appears. 2. Shedding tears. Emotional fragility, easily moved: When a man deeply loves someone, he becomes extremely emotionally fragile. He no longer hides his emotions but instead sheds tears over touching moments. These tears are not a sign of weakness but a natural outpouring of deep emotions for you. When he sees you feeling wronged, happy, or facing challenges, he can't help but shed tears because he deeply cares about everything about you. 3. Anger Because he cares, he gets upset: The deeper a man loves you, the more easily he gets angry because he cares. Every word or behavior of yours might touch his emotions. If you do something that worries, hurts, or leads to misunderstandings, he will display obvious signs of anger. This anger is not dissatisfaction with you but stems from him caring too much about you and hoping you can understand his feelings and intentions.\n```",

Regarding whether to return to China after graduating from a master's/PhD abroad or work abroad for a few years before returning: Consider job opportunities first; prioritize platforms with greater potential. If going global abroad is easier, why return to work locally in China? Conversely, if working globally in China is feasible, why go abroad for smaller CROs? ※ 2. Regarding hospital-related issues: If one day you no longer wish to work in statistics within enterprises, you can network to transition into a hospital role. However, if you choose to work in a hospital right after graduation or have been in hospital work for several years and then wish to enter enterprise statistics, the current environment makes that transition difficult.

However, during FM, when I had close eye contact with Taro, he had no expression and seemed cold, which scared me a bit. I couldn't relate to what my friend had described. The day before yesterday, at MCD, both Taro and Wonbin were very enthusiastic with fan service, and Taro even gave me a 👍. I was already very content. Today at Inkigayo, it was impossible to get closer than at MCD, so even though I brought a banner, I stood at the very back, simply enjoying the performance. ※ When it was Riize's turn, the sisters around me were super considerate, and fans from other groups even made room for me to move up. I ended up in about the fourth row, and as soon as he came on stage, he saw me. During standby, he peeked around from behind Eunseok and waved at me several times. He was so cute! After watching their performance, I was very satisfied and didn’t want to push forward. I gave up the spot to others and moved to the very back where I could lean on the railing. Although he wouldn’t see me anymore, the view was better! ※ Then, during one of the speeches, as soon as Taro came on stage, he spotted my banner again! Even though I was at the back, he waved at me first. I couldn’t believe it and waved back immediately, thinking it might just be a coincidence. But then he formed a heart above his head with both hands, not casually but with full commitment. I was so shocked, I jumped up, trying to respond, but I couldn’t because I was holding my light stick and banner. He noticed and laughed, then waved at me again before giving the same 👍 he had the day before at MCD, multiple times. ※ I froze for a moment, realizing this wasn’t just fan service for some random fan. He really remembered me😭😭😭😭😭 ※ I quickly switched my banner to one cheering for all of Riize, and Taro saw it, waved at me again, and gave me another 👍😭😭😭😭😭 ※ From that point on, until they left the stage, almost every time I waved, he would immediately respond if he saw it😭😭😭 ※ I was so happy and dazed watching them, left the venue in a haze, got on the car in a haze, and I am still in a haze even now😭😭😭 ※ Although I always say I am the happiest little girl in the world, today, because of Taro, it really feels true😭😭😭 ※ Thank you, Taro, for making my day.

Specialized Undergraduates; Postgraduate Exams for Specialized Students; Postgraduate; Graduate School Exams Is it really difficult for students from specialized undergraduate programs to take part in postgraduate exams? ※ 💪🏻 Senior’s advice: Rest assured and go for it! After upgrading to a regular undergraduate level, you can take the exams as a bachelor's degree holder. ※ . ※ 📣 Generally speaking, students who upgrade to regular undergraduate programs study for 2 years, which means you can register for postgraduate exams in October of your second year. Subsequently, you take the initial tests in December, participate in the second-round exams in March-April of the following year, graduate with a bachelor's degree in July, and start graduate school in September. ※ . ※ 📣 Advantages of postgraduate exams as a bachelor's degree holder include broader school selection, the ability to apply to graduate schools nationwide, and no need to participate in supplementary exams for equivalent academic qualifications. ※ . ※ 📣 Another benefit is that there are no additional requirements such as passing CET4 or 6 or publishing papers. For specialized students aiming for postgraduate exams, many schools require passing CET4/6 or publishing papers to qualify. However, as a bachelor's degree applicant after upgrading, these conditions no longer apply. ※ . ※ 📣 Lastly, there are no restrictions on discrimination in applications or major changes. Many institutions prohibit students with equivalent qualifications from applying across disciplines, whereas specialized undergraduates who upgrade can apply across majors. ※ . ※ 🔶 Furthermore, upgrading to regular undergraduate programs provides several advantages for postgraduate exams: ※ First, stronger information collection abilities and higher sensitivity to information. ※ 🔷 Upgrading and postgraduate exams share similarities; both require independent information collection, setting target schools, and intensive preparation and planning. ※ . ※ 🔷 Second, faster adaptability to the exam preparation pace. ※ Having experienced the intense process of upgrading undergraduate programs, students are familiar with high-pressure study plans and preparation. Postgraduate exams are an upgraded version of this experience. ※ . ※ 🔷 Third, greater discipline and willpower. ※ The experience of preparing for undergraduate program upgrades highlights the importance of education, leading to stronger preparation focus and perseverance. ※ . ※ 💪🏻 However, a word of advice from seniors: If you plan to take postgraduate exams after upgrading, plan early and prepare in advance. The 2 years of undergraduate studies are packed with academics, internships, and graduation theses, leaving limited time for postgraduate preparation. ※ . ※ 💪🏻 Both upgrading programs and postgraduate exams are not just long-term battles but also information battles. Success doesn’t come from a sudden idea or short-lived passion. Furthermore, after upgrading, you will directly follow third-year undergraduate courses, which are typically more intensive and challenging. Thus, you need to adjust to the course pace while carving out time amidst the heavy workload to prepare for postgraduate exams. ※ #GraduateExamForSpecializedStudents[Topic]# #AdviceForSpecializedStudents[Topic]# #SpecializedStudentCanSucceed[Topic]# #TipsFromGraduateExamSurvivors[Topic]# #GraduateExamInstitutions[Topic]# #GraduateExamForSecond-TierSchools[Topic]# #GoGraduateExamTakers[Topic]# #PostgraduateExam[Topic]# #PostgraduateExam2025[Topic]# #PostgraduateExam2026[Topic]# #GradExamInstitutionsRecommended[Topic]#\n```",

Princess Cut; Youthful Short Hair; Haircuts; Hairstyles; Wu Xin; Short Hair; Short-haired Girls; Ultra-short Hair; Long Hair. Why do Rainie Yang, Yuan Quan, and Wu Xin never grow their hair long again after cutting it short? Because their short hair looks better than long hair. Choosing the right hairstyle can double your charm. If you're looking to change your hairstyle but don't know which one suits you, today I recommend three short hairstyles, none of which will go wrong, especially the third one. It's flattering for anyone. Quickly tag your friend who wants short hair. ※ First Style: Light Princess Cut. The same as Rainie Yang and Wu Xin's style, youthful and premium, meeting the daily hairstyle needs of most girls. It can be elegant or alluring, suitable for diamond-shaped faces, round faces, oval faces and heart-shaped faces. Tell your stylist to keep the back length above the shoulders, the layer ratio at 4:1, and the side lengths controlled around the chin based on your face shape. It's essential that the back and sides are not too thick; they should be kept light, otherwise, it will turn out like this. ※ Second Style: Ultra-short Princess Cut, the same style as Go Joon-hee's. It's chic, refreshing, and exudes a sense of edginess, especially suitable for the summer and girls with thin hair. Suitable for V-shaped faces, round faces, straight-shaped faces, and diamond-shaped faces. Describe it to your stylist like this: Keep the length between the chin and shoulders. For girls with thick hair, the back should have layers to reduce volume, and the base cut should be even. Remember not to make it too thick. For those with thin hair, a single cut in the back is sufficient. The side lengths should be set above or below the cheekbones. Pairing it with fringe bangs gives a cute, soft look, while a middle-parted princess cut adds personality and elegance. ※ Third Style: Messy, Slightly Curled Short Hair, the same style as Yuan Quan's. Low-key, elegant, and dignified, it gives a natural charm without being too flashy. This hairstyle flatters everyone and enhances facial features, making the overall appearance more refreshing. Note that it requires curling treatment. Its key purpose is to create volume. The slightly curled top makes it easy to achieve a face-framing look. Combining it with airy bangs not only rejuvenates but also addresses issues like high hairlines or M-shaped hairlines. It suits various face shapes and hair textures. Curly hair or coarse hair can have this cut too. A small detail is the fringe around the temples, which can be customized based on the prominence of the cheekbones and jawlines. For curling, tell your stylist it must be vertical curls.

I told him I was a bit thirsty and asked him to bring down some water for me, but he said he was already downstairs, and I should have said earlier. I replied that I would just drink water at home, and he said, 'Then you should go back.' This made me so angry that I cried while taking the bus back home. When I got home, I sent him a message saying that I wouldn't go to see him again, and that we were done. I just don't understand what he means. Doesn't he love me anymore just because of May 20th?\n```",

When my craving collided with Juewei duck neck, I achieved duck tongue freedom. Spent 58 yuan on two big boxes of their signature duck tongue, so delicious I cried from the spiciness.

A couple of days ago, my friend went to buy Juewei's duck tongue, saying it was pretty tasty. Normally, duck tongue isn't very affordable though. Now, 58 yuan for 100 yuan worth is still a bargain. My box was worth 100 yuan. Do any of you like duck tongue, cuties~? I really like this QQ chewy texture. Duck tongue, duck intestines, duck neck—I love them haha. But once I start eating, I can’t stop. I added a bit of sugar (my sweet fermented rice). I’ve already started sniffling. It's truly so spicy. The one my friend bought for me... from Nayuki's. He said it’s super delicious. Never mind, I'll just eat it. The heat and the spice are overwhelming. Why did I hype it up (already spiced out). It was slightly frozen, so I'll just use half an Oreo. I like it. Though I bought it a couple days ago. Oh well, even if it's spoiled (might get an upset stomach, hahaha). Trying another one, this one is a bit softer. Ah, so hard, my teeth can't handle it. Too spicy. Passed out from the spice again. Let’s take a moment to recover, it's too spicy. Hello, today I’m eating Juewei duck neck. Hm. Wow. So good. Thank you. Hm. Ah. Oh my, this is not going well. Delicious. It's the setting sun. Wow, so spicy. Ouch, can't move on with this. Washing my face, kicked it later. Added some sugar, slightly easing the spice, but still sniffing. Threw it up, then ate it back. Don't go straight for it. Ah. Oh dear. Calm down, it's too spicy, sisters. So spicy, my friend bought this Nayuki’s one for me, but it’s wrong, okay—it’s not Nayuki tea—but an Oreo dish he said is amazing. Hahaha, let's heat it up and see if it's better, but never mind, I'll just eat it. Too spicy when heated, spicy and heat are a no-go together. Tasting it, questioning why I even hyped it up. Already dumbfounded. Hm, truly delicious. But since I just got back from outside, it's kind of frozen, like icy. Right, I'll use half a bottle. Love eating this, actually love all egg tarts. Sister. Told you. Barely anyone minds. Oh I. Ah. Singing a song. Okay. But yeah, it's been days since I bought it, might be spoiled, oh well. Hm. Sounds good. So hot. Became so gross. Tasting another, this one is softer. Ah. Hm, too hard for my teeth to manage. Oh well, coughing up a storm worth hundreds. Hm. No money left. Then. Too spicy. Bye-bye.\n```",

Admiring those who are good-looking comes with both opportunities and risks. The more opportunities there are, the more risks as well. Beautiful people attract all kinds of individuals, raising the chance of encountering bad ones. This explains why beautiful girls are more likely to attract bad partners. However, facing more challenges helps cultivate wisdom, improving one's ability to evaluate and understand people. From this fundamental perspective, there is no need to envy those who are good-looking. Beautiful people need to possess strong judgment, decision-making skills, and wisdom. To develop wisdom, they must endure more suffering than most. Most people are ordinary, and wise beauties are rare. Beauties without wisdom cannot enjoy a good life. Hence, many times, in many dimensions, Heaven's fairness lies in seeing if you have the ability to accept and bear the disadvantages behind your advantages. 🌟 This is just one advantage of being good-looking. Broadening the view to other dimensions, many people may admire others for having respectable jobs, high education, wealth, good backgrounds, being very rich, successful in a worldly sense, or having happy, harmonious families that look free. In reality, those who admire others can only see the surface and not the underlying essence. Every outward advantage comes with hidden disadvantages and challenges. From this perspective, if you were to exchange lives with someone you think is happier than you, you might not necessarily feel truly happy (you can watch the Korean movie \"Countdown\" to reflect further). There was a long period in my life when I was discontent, only noticing what I lacked, not what I had. I often envied those who seemed to have a better life than me, which left an empty void inside me. I lacked inner richness and the courage or strength to break boundaries in my actions. Understanding the fundamental logic behind this issue cleared everything up. It made me realize the importance of thinking deeply about the essence of things, making me happier both mentally and physically. I hope to think multidimensionally and from a higher perspective in the future. Critical thinking involves viewing things as a three-dimensional polyhedron, not a flat blueprint. Those with strong cores have experienced the grand scheme of the universe yet still cherish the small, ordinary things in life.\n Admiring the strong isn't wrong; it proves we seek to improve and have ambition. Therefore, there's no need for self-blame—it’s human nature. However, blind admiration of the strong can harm you by causing internal friction, anxiety, and unhappiness, making it not worth the effort. You live only once, so the most important thing is to be happy. Ultimately, the admiration of the strong should be directed toward yourself. Focus all your attention on yourself instead of others 💪. Work hard to become a strong person! Let's cheer each other on! #Reflections[Topic]# #Daily Thoughts[Topic]# #Self Value[Topic]# #Deep Reflections[Topic]# #Female Growth[Topic]# #Self Growth[Topic]##Admiring the Strong[Topic]# 24-5-29 01:17 from iphone posted in Beijing. This is just one advantage of being good-looking. Further expansion reveals that many people might admire others for respectable jobs, high education, substantial earnings, privileged backgrounds, wealth, happy families, freedom, or worldly definitions of success. In reality, those who admire others can only see the surface without understanding the depths and essence. Every outward advantage is accompanied by hidden disadvantages and struggles. From this viewpoint, if you swapped lives with someone you'd consider more fortunate, you might not genuinely feel happier (take time to watch the Korean movie \"Countdown\"). There was a prolonged phase in my life where I was stuck in dissatisfaction, only noticing what I lacked while ignoring what I already possessed. I constantly envied those who appeared happier than me, creating an eternal void in my heart, making it lack richness and leaving me powerless in actions. After examining the underlying logic of this problem, I finally understood and realized the importance of deep contemplation of life's essence. It brought me greater joy mentally and emotionally. I now aim to approach problems from multiple dimensions and higher standpoints. Thought processes should form a three-dimensional polyhedron rather than a two-dimensional blueprint. People with strong inner cores understand the vast universe yet still cherish the simplicity of life. Admiring the strong isn’t wrong; it demonstrates our desire to advance and ambition. We should not self-reproach—it aligns with human nature. But blind admiration may lead to inner exhaustion, anxiety, and unhappiness, which ruins the purpose. Life is short, so happiness is the key. Ultimately, self-admiration is paramount. Redirect all attention inward rather than outward. 💪 Let’s strive to become stronger together!\n```",

I switched to Chanel, then bought Bubble, but I don't know if it's too dry in winter or I haven't done enough moisturizing recently. The first day I put on makeup in Japan was a disaster! Cakey, patchy, and peeling! For me, Chanel works wonderfully when my skin is in good condition—it feels very moisturizing with a thin layer and not drying.) ※ 1. Pink Cushion, limited edition style, 400 yen more expensive. It's heavier than my Chanel but slightly lighter than the black version. The same 20 shade feels a bit whiter and thicker~ I'll probably go back to Chanel later, but I can use this when my skin isn't in the best state. ※ 2. E Powder Cake~ I used a Japanese brand before, but it was too big to carry with me, so I didn't bring it. In Japan, I asked my sisters while I was torn between Chanel and this. They all use this one, so I decided to buy it too. Turns out, it's great! No more oily shine! (I bought two: No.1 and No.6. In winter, my skin is dry, so I use No.6. In summer, my skin is oily, so I'll switch to No.1.) ※ 3. Cezanne Eyebrow Pencil, ultra-fine, makes brows look natural and distinct without smudging. I used Shu Uemura before. I'm not someone who tries out many products, so I didn't switch until now 🤦. This pencil looks so natural as if it's your own eyebrows! ※ 4. Canmake Eyeliner Pencil, for sisters who still struggle with hand trembling after all this time doing makeup! This pencil gets it done in one stroke; no matter how you start the day, it stays flawless—no smudging around the eyes. Immediately recommended it to my little sisters and bought several more! 👍 Goodbye to eyeliner pens! ※ 5. Kiss Me Mascara Remover, just like applying mascara; after a while, wipe with a cotton pad, and it's clean. I always felt Maybelline lip and eye removers couldn't clean mascara thoroughly, but this gets it done so easily!! ※ 6. Bobbi Brown Orange Cream, I tried it, and the difference it makes is night and day. After using the orange cream, there's no need for other moisturizers. It minimizes pores significantly upon applying foundation, avoiding the dotted white marks caused by cushions. I have large pores, and I absolutely love it! It also makes makeup adhere better. 🤳 ※ 7. Kose Aqua Moisture Cream, I have to mention it—I get so dry right after washing my face. Masks need to be applied for 15 minutes, but for me, my face dries out in 10 minutes to the point of oiling up. Seeing that it won a big award, I decided to try it. It's very solid, like chocolate, but once you poke it, it spreads easily on the face, releasing a burst of moisture. The texture feels amazing, will definitely use this for traveling, and it's affordable enough for carefree use. ※ 8. Canmake Tear Bag Highlighter, has several colors, and I bought this after testing them. Instantly creates innocent big eyes! Paired with gyaru vibes, unbeatable~ #Makeup[topic]##Cosmetics[topic]##BaseMakeup[topic]##OrangeCream[topic]##YSL Cushion[topic]##Canmake[topic]##E PowderCake[topic]##Chanel[topic]##Cosmetics[topic]# ※\n```",

Today we will talk about Shuxiang Jinyuan. At the entrance, there’s a foyer. This area is still filled with water for the moment. Over here is a flue pipe, and this part has a gas pipe. An open-plan kitchen can be made here, which is pretty okay. In this spot later, the air conditioner’s outdoor unit will be placed. You can also place a washing machine during renovations. Looking at the room inside, there is a north-facing secondary bedroom. This room’s size is about six-plus square meters. Currently, it should be around four square meters. Entering in, there is a small corridor. Then there is a 1.8m bed, which is pretty good. The insulation layer can be removed during later renovations. The entire bathroom is a sunken bathroom, and you don’t need to do any additional pipe noise-proofing. Soundproofing cotton is not necessary either.

Going further inside, you see the balcony. At that position later, there will be a three-part sliding door. One area here recedes inward, and this is where the air conditioning outdoor unit will be placed later. The north-facing secondary bedroom has a similar layout to most finished rooms. Its size is around six-plus square meters, and overall, it’s pretty good with very bright lighting. At this moment, it’s probably about four o'clock in the afternoon. Further inside is the master bedroom. At the entrance, there’s a small hallway, and there’s a wardrobe inside. There’s also a 1.8m bed with a bay window, which is quite nice. In the house, some parts belong to insulation layers that can be removed later. This is the bathroom area. For this section of the bathroom, there’s a toilet pipe.

Property Ownership; Real Estate. Does adding a child's name to the property ownership certificate involve fees? ※   ※ It does involve fees! Adding a child's name to a property ownership certificate can be done through gifting or sale. If parents choose to gift their property to their children, the associated costs include deed tax, notarization fees, and property registration fees. For properties held for more than five years, the property can be transferred using a purchase method, and the transfer costs will be the same as second-hand property transaction taxes and fees. Gifting may incur a 20% personal income tax on the property's appraised value when sold in the future. For bank loans, the guardian would be responsible for repayment. If the transaction method is used, notarization is not required, saving notarization costs, though transaction fees will apply. For a transaction-based approach, existing loans must first be paid off. The biggest advantage of this method is that you can declare your transaction price and won't need to pay for property appraisal fees. ※ Three scenarios for adding names to property ownership certificates ※ 1. Adding a spouse's name: For married couples, as long as you have a marriage certificate and other relevant documents, go directly to the local real estate transaction center and handle it at the property ownership change window. The cost is about 150 RMB for administrative and document fees. 2. Adding a child or parent's name: If the property certificate already has the names of both spouses, and you want to add a child or parent's name, you need to first have the house appraised at the real estate transaction center because this is treated as a property sale. ※ 3. Adding a name without a direct blood relationship: If you are not married or there is no direct blood relation, adding a name to the property ownership certificate is much more complicated because it is considered a property sale, and the fees will be significantly higher. ※ Required documents and considerations for adding names to property certificates: ※ 1. Required documents: Property ownership certificate, household registry, ID card, proof of marital status (marriage certificate or single status certification). For minor children, a household registry or birth certificate is required. In addition to bringing all necessary documents, prepare photocopies of each document. ※ 2. Considerations: When handling the addition of names at the local transaction center, both the property's owner and the person to be added as an owner must be present. ※ #HaveIdeasPostEasily[Topic]# Does adding a child's name to the property ownership certificate involve fees?

Suddenly, it’s a certain holiday ※ ※ Recently, some friends asked ※ ※ how to choose white tiles ※ ※. In this issue, we’ll explore the details ※ ※ #Tiles [Topic]# #Decoration [Topic]# #SciencePopularization [Topic]# #Selection [Topic]# #WhiteTiles [Topic]#. The most comprehensive white tile selection guide on the internet. AI tips are something like this for their effects. The first part is finished, please move to the second part. The content of this episode is a bit long but full of valuable tips. If you're planning to buy or use these tiles, you must watch it till the end. Today we will teach you how to select white tiles. In fact, 'white tiles' is a general term, referring to all tiles that are white in color. And why have white tiles become popular in the past two years? You might have seen many cases, and even considered using them for your own renovation. I think the reason white as an element is so common and useful in home décor—and also quite timeless. In the past few years, styles like Wabi-sabi and Minimalism have expanded the use of white tiles, utilizing them better. Overall, white tiles can be categorized into two color tones: warm tones and cool tones. Warm tones, as the name suggests, have a cozy, creamy appearance. On the other hand, cool tones appear more modern and sophisticated. The differences also manifest in the tile's surface finish. You'll often hear terms like matte and satin finishes. Of course, besides matte and satin, there’s also glossy, but glossy isn’t ideal in certain styles as it lacks subtle texture and sophistication. So usually, matte and satin, which are non-reflective, are more commonly chosen. Matte tiles feel dry to the touch and have more resistance, sometimes even a slightly rough surface. Satin tiles, however, are distinctly smooth and soft to the touch, more pleasant overall. The choice depends on personal preference. For example, last year, our matte 2U tiles sold exceptionally well. I had explained before in a video that their matte finish creates a nearly zero-reflection look under lights, especially paired with seamless grout, mimicking a microcement effect. But one downside is that matte surfaces are harder to clean, not because they stain or can't be wiped clean, but because the surface texture requires special cleaning tools or agents. Although sophisticated-looking, they are less practical for daily maintenance. Satin tiles, on the other hand, combine non-reflectiveness and elegance with a user-friendly surface, making them easier to clean and maintain in everyday use. While they still require some tools and cleaning aids, they are smoother than matte and thus relatively easier to clean. When it comes to choosing between cool tones and warm tones, consider your home style: cool tones work for monochrome palettes like black, white, and gray—ideal for a high-end minimalist look. Warm tones are softer and pair well with earthy colors, creamy shades, or a Wabi-sabi vibe. Lighting is another key factor. In spaces with good natural lighting, warm tones can work as they have a lower saturation in whiteness. However, in low-light conditions, warm tones may appear grayish instead of warm. In such cases, brighter, cooler tones are recommended—with more pure white hues for better results. The final decision depends on combining tile choice with your overall furniture, style, and lighting conditions.\n```",

'Fairy Tale' is a song released by Guang Liang in 2005, and it was extremely popular at the time. How popular? Jay Chou's 'Nocturne' ranked second, and 'Fairy Tale' ranked first. Kenny really likes the song 'Fairy Tale.' On November 24, 2005, during a radio program, he recommended this song. In 2006, Hins Cheung accompanied himself on the piano and sang 'Fairy Tale' on a Guangzhou variety show called 'Who's the King of Singers.' He covered 'Fairy Tale' live at a concert in 2009. At Kwong Mei-wan's birthday banquet, Hins and Kenny performed 'Fairy Tale' together. After reuniting in 2018, Hins sang 'Fairy Tale' again during a livestream. ※ Kenny is very fond of Leon Lai's song 'My Dear.' After attending Leon's concert, he even updated his social media to express regret for not hearing that song live. In 2021, Hins Cheung attended Leon's concert as a guest for the eighth show and sang 'My Dear' as a duet with Leon. Before the performance, Hins said: 'I can sing all your songs. Tonight, I chose a classic that you rarely perform in public.' ※ Kenny was also a fan of Hikaru Utada. During an interview as a newcomer, he mentioned her music. One of Hikaru Utada's most iconic songs is 'First Love.' In 2022, during 'The Revisit' concert, Hins Cheung sang 'First Love' by Hikaru Utada. On December 21 of that year, Kenny was seen singing along in the audience, and it was captured on video. At that time, this pairing was still considered a niche ship, but the video was still shared on forums, with fans joking that Kenny caught the 'concert girlfriend' vibe and showed too much affection. ※ Of course, we cannot ignore the classic and well-known 'Loving You.' It's said that when Hins performed this song while playing the piano, it was as if a spotlight shone right on him. After the performance, Kenny gave him a hug. In 2018, Hins sang it again. ※ On a variety show, when asked about his criteria for a partner, Kenny's immediate response was to 'sing a song first.' Kenny is indeed a big softie.

When dating, the relationship with my wife was great, but after marriage, it became a mess. Quarrels every day, and it feels like she transformed from a sweet girl to a tough woman instantly. Why is that? After marriage, her restrictions on me increased. Playing a few games at night feels like the entire room is filled with low pressure. Can this still work? Questions like this are abundant in consultations. Marriage and personal hobbies, which seem to be non-conflicting, often become opposing forces. The reason lies in the change of roles and expectations. Take women as an example: during dating, they expect their boyfriend to provide emotional support, hence they can live on love alone. After marriage, they expect their husband to solve problems because marriage brings one test after another: parents, children, living costs. Two kids need to become two well-prepared soldiers, and the one who adapts later is often criticized. Any hobby that takes up a large amount of time, if excessive, will certainly affect family relationships. Fishing, traveling, mobile games, drinking with friends—these hobbies might spice up life before marriage but can easily spark debates afterward. To make an inappropriate analogy, imagine your roommate is great at playing mobile games and skips meals, leaving you to bring food. You might laugh it off. But when you're assigned the same group for a graduation project and they spend time quarrelling in games instead of working on the midterm report, won't you feel annoyed? In your eyes, the time they spend on hobbies might have deprived the responsibilities they should fulfill in shared projects or marriage. So essentially, it's not hobbies affecting marital relationships but an inadequately performed responsibility that damages it. Recently, while playing the Classic World of Warcraft, I encountered many humorous occurrences. For instance, during dungeon runs, when everyone is ready for battle, the tank suddenly said, 'Sorry, brothers, my kid is crying. I'll go comfort them.' Mid-battle, the mage typed, 'Hurry up, my kid's about to start their online class.' While these interruptions disrupted gaming experiences countless times, they showed all those players were responsible family men who prioritized their families. I think maintaining such boundaries likely supports family harmony. Oh, here's another thing: a guy on the forum joked about the difficulties of middle-aged gaming, saying he could only play after the 'warden' and 'head guard' were asleep. A confused junior asked, 'They let prisoners have computers now?' A married member immediately clarified, 'It's obvious you've never married; can't you tell those two terms refer to the wife and kids?' 2. If possible, it's still advisable for couples to cultivate shared hobbies. Sociologist Mitzen once surveyed nearly 500 harmonious couples and concluded: relationships can become closer through sharing everything or certain beliefs. Reality supports this too; many couples focusing heavily on their careers often divorce quickly due to long separations, especially in the entertainment industry. We can all understand this phenomenon. Since 2020, I've almost received weekly cases of couples breaking up due to long-distance relationships caused by the pandemic. Such situations cut off dating experiences while virtual interactions lack meaningful topics, visibly decreasing relationship intensity. However, a certain type of long-distance relationship remains strong—where couples can game together, like in team-based games. This companionship during such times satisfies both parties' needs for connection. 5783 likes, 375 comments Answer: My husband drinks a sugar-free cola every night before going to bed; what should I do? My husband drinks a sugar-free cola before bed every night. I've told him many times, but he won't listen. Is sugar-free cola really harmless? 2559 likes, 342 comments Answer: These people have a cognitive bias: 'If you love me, you should always put me first.' The husband's behavior doesn't meet their expectations, proving that he doesn't prioritize them in these choices—choosing fitness over them, cola over them. This creates a strong sense of loss of control and fear of 'death', leading to conflict. Such cognition doesn't permit the existence of hobbies in the other half, further deepening conflicts.\n```",

Even before the Euro Cup starts, merchants on the international platform have already experienced the heat of the overseas market. @Henan Shengkun Sporting Goods Co., Ltd.'s He Jiakun is a fresh graduate this year. Last May, while in his junior year in the sports department, he took some time to start a business, selling fitness equipment to the European and American markets. In one year, he made 3 million. Now, like his peers, he is busy graduating, but his appearances are mostly in the shared entrepreneurial spaces near the school library, not at job fairs. With the overseas event-driven economic boom, he is busy using AI to reverse select clients he cannot attend to, letting them help him raise profits by 40%. ※ 01 Starting a business before graduating, earning 3 million ※ I majored in sports, so I am very familiar with industry trends and product features of sporting equipment. ※ For instance, for gym strength machines, well-known foreign brands charge $20,000 to $30,000 per unit. China's products are no worse than theirs; instead, leveraging the massive labor market and complete industrial chain systems, we can achieve optimized cost-effectiveness. I found a factory in Shandong that can provide the same quality of product for a more competitive price—4,000 to 5,000 yuan. This highlights the overseas appeal of Chinese products. A steel-spliced strength training bench used to lag behind foreign products because the movement trajectory differed. However, professional athletes have corrected it, making it meet international standards one-to-one. But with this information, I discovered during my nationwide factory tours that many factories were unaware. The factories have products, and I understand product knowledge better. Together, we became the best partners for going global. The market loves Chinese goods, and there is always demand for high-quality and cost-effective Chinese products. Based on the strength of factories in domestic industrial clusters, combined with my cutting-edge product expertise, fitness equipment like strength training benches became popular in mid-level European and American markets after optimizations. In just over a year after opening my store, I made 3 million. ※ 02 Letting clients help me raise profits to 40% ※ Too many clients to manage; using AI to reverse select clients: With innovative products, the overseas sports boom, and AI business assistant-optimized product titles and images boosting our click-through rate sixfold, we now have 5,000 to 6,000 client inquiries. My company has just me and one classmate, and we simply can't handle the replies and management. While wanting to expand the team, we didn’t have enough funds temporarily. Fortunately, there’s AI. I use Okki AI to categorize and manage these clients, send regular marketing messages, and match them precisely, greatly improving efficiency. Many clients require insight and selection. Using Okki AI, I can do background checks on client companies, check if they have local retailers or warehouses, and review additional customs data. If they have all these, it indicates they are a significant client needing focused service. I now have a Polish client I’ve investigated. He has a local website, and his previous order volume was over 40 containers. #Alibaba [Topic]# #Alibaba International Platform [Topic]# #Cross-border E-commerce [Topic]# #Finding Clients for Foreign Trade [Topic]# #Fujian [Topic]# Starred Alibaba International Platform Don’t miss any updates on making money from going global\n```",

Our family of five traveled to Guilin, and it's actually very inconvenient for five people to call a car. A five-seater car can't fit us, and a business seven-seater is very expensive. When we first arrived in Yangshuo, we had to call two cars via Didi each time we went out, until the second day when we were heading to Xingping Ancient Town, we happened to meet this driver. He drove a business seven-seater car, and during the ride, we chatted and added him on WeChat. The driver was very nice. When we wanted to watch 'Eternal Love' show, he helped us buy tickets in the VIP area, with great seats! And the price was cheaper than the one we inquired about at the hotel. For the next few days, we directly hired him for chartered trips. This saved us from calling two cars each time. He also charged fair prices without any scams. He always arrived on time to pick us up, dropping us off at our destinations. After we finished our activities, we'd send him a message on WeChat, and he'd arrive on time, never keeping us waiting. We even hired him for a day trip to Longji Terraces. The mountain roads were rugged and bumpy, but the driver showed excellent driving skills and was very familiar with the routes. He was practically like a tour guide for us—recommending places to visit and even suggesting a great restaurant at the foot of Moon Hill. All of his recommendations were spot-on, and we had no bad experiences. ※ Here's a share about a parent-child hotel we stayed in Guilin city: 'Poetry and Distant Place - Xiangshan Youyue Hotel.' Its location is in downtown Guilin. The environment, as seen in the pictures, is full of vacation vibes. It's within walking distance to Elephant Trunk Hill and Sun & Moon Twin Towers. The service was impeccable, and the breakfast options were abundant. ※ Another place we dined at is also a guesthouse near Longji Terraces called 'Wild Hope Taste'. You can dine while overlooking the terraces. The location is difficult to find but you can contact the owner, and they might send a car to pick you up if they're not busy. ※ After five days in Guilin, my summary is that since the attractions are scattered, it's best to hire a chartered car. I still prefer free travels. Guilin has many caves. Among them are Silver Cave, Nine-Dragon Pond, etc., but just visiting one is enough. In my opinion, for taking photos of Miao ethnic girls, the Longji Terraces are the best location or perhaps along the Li River. The Longji Terraces are a must-see, whether in sunny or rainy weather—it’s stunning! The only downside is that we didn’t find any particularly unique culinary experiences. Almost every restaurant serves beer fish, bamboo chicken, and bamboo rice; they all taste quite similar. Now the weather in Guilin has cleared up, and there’s no more flooding—everyone can plan their trips without worry! #GuilinTravel[topic]# #GuilinCharteredCar[topic]# ##EnjoyingNatureTogether[topic]# #GuilinTravelGuide[topic]#\n```",

Dinner on July 6th: ※ My family, along with two cousin’s families, three families dining together, chose a street vendor near my house. Beer paired with lobsters and barbecue is the best in summer evenings. After the feast, as the first-choice child-care person, I was assigned the heavy responsibility of taking care of three kids at the amusement park nearby. You might remember that day when I shared a video of us playing bumper cars together. It was great fun because it was my first time trying it. ※ ※ Changing phone screens: ※ My phone screen broke, and the shards could cut fingers, so I bought a screen online and replaced it myself. However, the result was unsatisfactory, so I reverted to the original screen and returned the purchased one. In the process, I practiced phone repair techniques and learned about phone screens, gaining a lot. Next, I plan to visit a repair shop to replace just the outer screen. ※ ※ Danger! The boy next to Kim Go-eun: ※ Both her dad and I were shocked when we saw this picture; I already imagined her tearfully saying goodbye to us at her wedding. Only her mom, my sister-in-law, said: hehe, shipping them together. ※ ※ Why the balance is still 2.11 million: ※ I didn’t systematically review this. Took my family to Shanghai several times; dining, lodging, and transportation were significant expenses. I thought even 2.09 million wouldn’t last, but after counting today, it’s still 2,115,421. My guess: it’s due to a combination of unemployment benefits, provident fund annual interest settlement, and fixed interest income, while self-media earnings didn’t contribute much. Anyway, the number returned to 2.11. Not that I was anxious before, but this makes me even more carefree. Bringing 2.11 back to Shangqiu, spent 3 months, still 2.11, isn’t it annoying? ※ (Turns to bodyguards: Please protect me) ※ (Bodyguard: I really feel like hitting you twice) ※ ※ MoWen Memo: ※ 1. A WeChat Mini Program combining memos and a textual community platform. By offering a robust and user-friendly payment mechanism and catering to a high-willingness-to-pay premium user base, it positively guides creators in learning how to maintain high-quality columns. ※ 2. This product was launched by a well-known veteran of the IT industry, Chi Jianqiang @MacTalk. I introduced this senior in my livestream. He became president of Geekbang in 2017 and launched Geek Time. MoWen Memo is his hopeful new work. ※ 3. On July 4th, I was invited to join the platform; on the evening of July 6th, I launched two paid columns, sharing book reviews, film reviews, and life insights. Soon, I received 4 subscriptions and 100 yuan in subscription income. ※ 4. I plan to launch two more columns later: one on historical writing, another on general AI learning notes. This platform excellently satisfies my writing desires. ※ 5. This note is not an advertisement. Firstly, it records this incident; secondly, it spontaneously promotes the platform. Friends who love writing can give it a try. ※ ※ Goodnight: ※ Originally, I didn’t plan to update since everyone’s probably asleep. I worried about poor data metrics. But @NanboLambor said it doesn’t matter. I said, right, you are correct. Data is important but not everything. Life should go with the flow and not deviate because of it. Those still awake are lucky, watching the lobster on the cover with an empty stomach. Don’t scold me; I’m hungry too. Good night, friends. See you tomorrow. ※ ※ The phone mount on the electric bike wasn’t secure. Every time the bike hit a speed bump, the phone would fall. After some trials, my 2-year-old iPhone 13 ended up in such condition. Only the outer screen broke, not the inner one; the display function remained normal. I’m not a perfectionist, so I didn’t mind the large cracks on the screen. But I had to replace it because the glass shards started cutting my hands. I couldn’t ignore that the edges were grimy with years-old dirt. Static electricity attracted dust and lint, and the screen gaps were hard to clean, accumulating with time. Also, it indirectly shows that some parts of a phone are dirtier than a toilet. The old screen was removed, a new one was installed. Apple devices have cleanly sealed internal modules, making screen replacement relatively simple. Although it was my first time, after watching tutorial videos, I successfully replaced it without many mishaps. However, the screen quality was poor. Its refresh rate was noticeably lower than the original, touchscreen response was delayed, and even the pixels seemed reduced. After negotiating with the seller, I returned the screen and reinstalled the original cutting-hand one. More experienced this time, I completed the replacement in minutes. What’s the next step? Two options: buy a better-condition original screen for about 500-600 yuan, or visit a repair shop to replace only the outer screen. I haven’t inquired about the latter’s price yet; it shouldn’t be too costly. I’ll proceed with option one tomorrow.\n```",

Mainly producing second-tier or above quality; sorry, lower-end brands may not be suitable. ※ Support high-quality small orders|Support small batch production|Support single-piece customization|Support pattern-making based on provided designs ※ 💪 Our advantages: Skilled in creating patterns from images, offering full-service production. Yes! Simply provide your design images, ideas, and detailed descriptions of size and fit, and our artisans will bring your vision to life with precise patterns—not amateur work. High-quality experienced pattern makers on board can finalize the design within at most two iterations, avoiding repeated back-and-forth communication during sample development. This meets the needs of many startup fashion companies. ※ We offer opportunities to support young entrepreneurs wishing to create their own clothing brands. Since original designs cannot be sourced from the market, they must be custom-produced. However, initial order quantities can be small, making it challenging to find suitable factories, as quality factories usually require minimum order quantities of 200-500 pieces. Low quantities discourage workers from taking on such jobs, effectively ending the project before it starts. But we are willing to grow alongside these startups by offering limited slots for passionate individuals needing a minimum of 60 pieces for custom production. Note that supporting too many of such cases may strain factory operations, so we appreciate your understanding. ※ Accepting production orders for various types of women's wear, men's wear, coats, workwear, children's clothing, including independent design pattern-making, sample creation, and both small and large-scale production partnerships. ※ 【Full Production or Material Processing】 ※ For material processing, our factory will focus solely on manufacturing; you need to provide the clothes samples/patterns, fabrics, accessories, and materials. ※ For full production, you provide the clothing designs and patterns, and our factory will handle everything else. ※ Ideally, patterns should be made by us to foresee risks and address problems before mass production. Avoid using patterns made in small workshops for production elsewhere, as lack of involvement during development or craftsmanship guidance can lead to issues. ※ 【For With or Without Samples】 ※ With samples: Sample—Factory sources fabric—Creates sample for review—Customer confirms pattern—Price confirmation—Order details—Shipment delivery. Without samples: Design sketches—Factory sources fabric—Customer confirms fabric—Sample creation—Pattern confirmation—Price confirmation—Order details—Shipment delivery. ※ 【How to Collaborate Remotely】 ※ Communicate with the factory online to discuss what clothing category can be handled. Send samples or designs for pattern-making and review garment quality. If nearby, a factory tour is welcome for a more hands-on experience. Feel free to reach out anytime. ※ 【Lead Time after Placing Order】 ※ Lead time depends on design complexity and the factory's current schedule.

We hear a lot about breast cancer, but what exactly is breast fibroadenoma? ※ Breast fibroadenoma is a common benign tumor of the breast in women, mainly occurring in one or both breasts or in deeper areas of the breast. It is most common among young women, particularly those aged 20-40. In the early stages, there are usually no symptoms, but in later stages, if the lump becomes harder, less movable, and grows slowly, it may be difficult to detect and easily mistaken for breast cancer. ※ Some may ask, how does someone seemingly healthy develop breast fibroadenoma? How does it happen? ※   Psychological factors: High mental stress and excessive tension can excite the cerebral cortex, inhibit the functions of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, affecting ovarian ovulation, which may also elevate estrogen levels, stimulating excessive growth of the breast and forming fibroadenoma. ※   Endocrine factors: Estrogen is positively correlated with the occurrence of breast fibroadenoma. ※   Genetic factors: If someone in the family has breast fibroadenoma, the next generation is more likely to develop it. ※   Smoking and drinking: Smoking and drinking can stimulate excessive growth of the breast. ※ Although most breast fibroadenomas are benign tumors and may shrink, it is still better to seek medical attention as soon as one is detected for early treatment. ※  #Breast[Topic]# #Breast Fibroadenoma #Breast Health[Topic]# Breast Fibroadenoma\n```",

Study; Graduate Exam; Graduate Exam Politics; Graduate Exam English Recently, when chatting with a friend, she told me that she spends her days studying public courses by enrolling in online classes from various institutions. This means she is tightly packed with English and politics lessons, bombarded by teaching assistants every day! Only at night, she has two to three hours to study for her major courses ※   ※ Please do NOT do this!!! ※ The most important thing for graduate exam preparation is having proactivity and taking control of time management in your own hands. Only this way can you address your specific study needs, balance strengths and weaknesses! Clearly, if you are good at English, why continue learning grammar classes in July? Clearly, if you can memorize vocabulary, why spend two hours on guided vocabulary classes in July? Clearly, if you understand political knowledge points, why take a foundational class before moving on to an advanced one? ※   ※ Time is limited. The most scientific method is to allocate your daily study time based on the weight of each exam subject. For example, if you study 8 hours a day and your major courses make up 3/5 of your total exam score, you should spend at least 4.8 hours on major courses daily. English and politics each take up 1/5, so ideally, you should spend no more than 1.6 hours on them each per day. On this basis, adjust your study time allocation based on your current learning status (e.g., if you haven’t started your major course studies at all, you need to allocate more time to it, extending your total study time overall), learning ability (e.g., if you are already proficient in English, go straight to practicing exam questions; there’s no need to watch too many lessons), and the requirements of your university (e.g., for universities with high scores for public courses in Beijing, you’ll need to allocate more time to public course improvement). ※   ※ In short, all courses should serve your actual needs. Do not create a need to attend classes just because there are classes available. Attending classes is the easiest part. Thinking and outputting are the phases that truly make you progress. ※ (Attached is my July daily subject schedule, low energy version with no early mornings or late nights and rest every three to four days) ※ #New Media Graduate Exam[Tag]# #25 New Media Graduate Exam[Tag]# #Graduate Exam[Tag]# #Graduate Exam English[Tag]# #Graduate Exam Politics[Tag]# July Daily Schedule (Low Energy Version) 9:00-9:15 Wake up (I really can't wake up early). 9:15-10:00 Learn 100 new words + review. 10:00-12:00 Memorize 1-2 chapters of major courses. 12:00-13:30 Lunch + nap. 13:30-15:30 Online course study for major courses. 15:30-17:00 Do 1 past paper + review lecture on reading. 17:00-18:00 Dinner. 18:00-19:20 1 session of politics course + corresponding 1000 questions. 19:20-21:30 Major course study (review online course, organize and memorize notes, do practice problems, or finish unfinished material). 21:30-22:00 Return to dormitory for shower and wash up. 22:00-23:30 Play games or watch variety shows, then call it a day.

Not only is it a beautiful garden decoration, but it can also thrive indoors in pots, adding a touch of natural charm to the interior. Let's explore the beauty of potted jasmine and learn how to care for it properly. ※ 1. The Beauty of Jasmine: ※ Jasmine leaves are tender green, its flowers pure white, exuding a rich fragrance. Its fresh and captivating scent can effectively repel mosquitoes and other pests common in summer, filling homes with a pleasant atmosphere during the spring and summer seasons. ※ 2. Choosing Potted Jasmine: ※ To pot jasmine, you may opt for types like multi-flower aromatic jasmine or dwarf aromatic jasmine. When purchasing, choose healthy plants with vibrant green leaves and no pests. Jasmine plants in their seeding phase are relatively easy to manage and ideal for beginners. ※ 3. Potting and Care: ※ Use pots with good permeability to ensure proper drainage. The size of the new pot should be 1-2 cm larger than the old one to prevent overly rapid growth of the plant; use breathable soil and mix in an appropriate amount of leaf mold and sand. From spring to autumn, fertilize the plant once a month, and in winter reduce fertilization appropriately; jasmine prefers ample sunlight, though during the summer heat, it should be protected from direct exposure. The suitable indoor temperature is between 15°C and 25°C; water management is crucial — keep the soil moist but not overly wet. During summer, frequently spray water to increase air humidity and prevent jasmine leaves from drying out. Trim jasmine plants appropriately to maintain a neat appearance. Perform moderate pinching every spring and autumn to promote branching and growth. ※ #Planting[Topic]# #Jasmine[Topic]# Jasmine\n```",

I was so worried, it made me so sad. ※ Demand: Next time, don't suddenly disappear like this, okay? Send me a message before you're busy; that's what a good boy would do! Otherwise, just go find someone else, humph. ※ 🌰 Boyfriend didn’t take care of you ※ 🌰 Point of anger (period): I’m on my period and feeling really unwell, baby, but you didn’t take care of me at all, it makes me so sad. Demand: Can you make me a cup of brown sugar water and keep my tummy warm? That would make me feel much better~ ※ 🌰 Point of anger (cold): I caught a cold and feel so terrible. You didn’t even come check on me or make me some medicine! So sad! Am I not your little beloved anymore? 555 ※ What you think he would do: I thought you’d take good care of me. ※ 🌰 Boyfriend forgot your birthday ※ Point of anger: So heartbroken (his nickname), you actually forgot my birthday. ※ What you think he would do: I thought you’d prepare a gift and a small cake for me, 555. ※ If he’s unwilling to communicate with you or doesn’t change and keeps upsetting you intentionally, then you might need to consider finding a new one. ※ Author @is the Guru.

Honestly, every time we take the baby for these check-ups, it’s just with the hope that she stays healthy! ※ ※ 🍓1. First of all, seeing my baby's growth indicators met the standards, height 72.9cm, weight 9.1kg, head circumference 41.8cm, as a mother, I felt so relieved! But do you know? I was a little disappointed with the DDST test process; it seemed a bit simple. I wonder if standards are different in different places? ※ ※ 2. DDST Test ※ Gross motor development evaluation ※ Pull-to-sit test: When pulling the baby, they have the strength to sit up; when sitting independently, there may be slight tilting ※ 👋 Fine motor skills check: Holding and shaking a bell with both hands, taking the given red bean chain to see if the baby can pick up small objects ※ 👄 Language development: Whether the baby can produce sounds like 'aaa' and 'mm,' showing the desire to speak ※ ※ 🍉3. Physical examination ※ Full body system check: Abdominal tapping, listening to the heart, liver, lungs, leg creases, eyes, ears, neck, joints ※ Skin: Large area of Mongolian spots on the back, which will disappear when the child is about 4.5 years old ※ Teeth: Being told that teeth are about to erupt, oh! I also forgot to ask about night feeding and its effects on teeth while side-lying for breastfeeding ※ Fontanel check: The anterior fontanel size for a 6-month-old baby is about 1.0cm x 1.0cm ※ 🍎4. Laboratory tests: ※ CBC: Obtaining finger blood from the tip of the right-hand middle finger; massage beforehand to reduce pain ※ Micronutrient testing: Calcium, iron, and zinc indicators were normal, no supplements were prescribed ※ Other A.D.E reports: Results to be delivered in a week, feeling anxious ※ ※ 🍌5. Ultrasound bone density test: Passed as well ※ ※ 🍊6. Feeding guidance ※ Guidelines for types and amounts of complementary foods added ※ Milk intake: 800-1000ml ※ Complementary food addition: ※ Rice cereal: Gradually increase to 5g-50ml water, move from thin to thick consistency ※ Later increased to 20g-30ml ※ Being an allergy-prone baby ※ Start with root vegetables: Potatoes, sweet potatoes🍠, pumpkins🎃, carrots ※ Then fruit puree: Avoid cold-natured fruits where possible ※ Mashed veggies: Prioritize safe vegetables ※ Egg yolk: Add small amounts at 7 months, gradually increase ※ Meat puree: Introduce at 8-9 months ※ Allergenic foods: Add highly allergenic foods after 1 year ※ ※ 7. 👀 Ophthalmology check: ※ Consulted an ophthalmologist separately, found that astigmatism was more severe than the last check; this feeling, prescribed myo-inositol liquid to promote eye recovery ※ ※ [Laughter tears emoji] Finally, I want to say, every time I come back from a check-up, there’s an \"If only I'd asked more questions\" moment. So, dear moms, make sure to prepare your list of questions in advance!

These opening lines will surely be liked by girls! ※ When reconnecting with a girl you haven't contacted in a long time, it requires some skills and carefulness. Here are some methods and opening lines to make it easier to reconnect with her: #ChasingAGirl [Topic] #ChattingSkills [Topic] #BlindDate [Topic] How to chat with a girl you haven't contacted for a long time? These opening lines will surely be liked by girls! Reconnecting with a girl you haven't been in touch with for a long time requires some skills and carefulness. Here are some methods and opening lines to make it easier for you to re-establish a connection: 1. How to chat with a girl you haven't contacted for a long time? Stay calm and rebuild the connection: When facing a girl you haven't contacted for a long time, maintain a calm demeanor. While reconnecting, avoid being too impulsive or anxious, control your emotions, and don't let her attitude affect you. Even if she doesn't reply, don't question or blame her; you can try again after some time. Initiate and conclude topics, rebuild value: Pay attention to the changes in her replies. If she starts replying to you but only with brief messages, this might indicate some interest in you. During the conversation, take the initiative to end the topic, maintain some mystery, make her curious about you, and rebuild your value in her mind. Don't give too much blindly, rebuild attraction: Avoid being overly eager to ask her out or give gifts, as this can make you appear desperate. Learn to control your offerings and rebuild your attractiveness, making her interested in you again. I was previously clueless about conversation skills, and my chats with girls always ended poorly, sometimes even leading to being blocked or deleted, all due to awkward conversations. I just didn't know how to chat effectively. Later, I used \"Wei Small Chengxu - Love Chat Secret Techniques,\" which specifically teaches how to chat. Whenever I'm unsure how to reply to a girl's message, I just input her message into the tool, and it automatically provides many response examples. Now, I have successfully found a partner. I think it’s perfect for single brothers who lack flirting skills. How to chat with a girl you haven't contacted for a long time? These opening lines will surely be liked by girls! 2. How to start a conversation with a girl you haven't contacted for a long time? Start with an Emoji: Sending a funny or humorous emoji can ease the awkwardness, help both sides let down their guard, and increase the chances of a reply. Start based on her social media posts: Using a topic from her social media posts can help you find common ground, making it easier to start a conversation and show your interest in her. Start by asking for help: Use the pretext of needing help to start a conversation. This kind of opening comes across as less intent-driven, avoiding a sense of estrangement or awkwardness, and allowing for a natural transition to other topics. Start humorously: Using a humorous opening line can create a relaxed and pleasant atmosphere, avoid awkwardness, and make the interaction more engaging. Reconnecting with a girl you haven't contacted for a long time requires patience and skill; choosing the right approach and opening lines can help you establish a connection more easily and rekindle communication between the two of you.\n```",

Tent manufacturers share tent knowledge without reservation!! ※ ?Vinyl or silver coating, which one is better? ※ 1. Firstly, it’s clear that the UV protection difference between vinyl and silver coatings is minimal. ※ Their sunblock performance is comparable. ※ ※ 2. Compared to silver, vinyl coating is less prone to peeling off and has a longer lifespan. Vinyl wins overall~ ※ 3. Black material absorbs heat, but if the outer layer is light-colored, it will reflect part of the sunlight, reducing the heat absorption of the black vinyl, making it less hot inside the tent. ※ ?Is it better to use an automatic tent or a manually assembled one? ※ The advantages of automatic tents are that they’re very convenient to set up and store away; a single person can easily complete the setup and storage within two to three minutes, saving leisure time. Those who are less patient might find the complexity of manual assembly affects their mood. ※ The disadvantages of automatic tents: 1. They take up more storage space and are longer when stored. However, most private car trunks can still fit them easily. 2. The wind resistance of automatic tents is inferior to that of manual ones. For professional camping players who enjoy hiking and mountaineering, the manual tent is the first choice. It has a smaller and lighter packing size with better wind resistance. ※ For general camping players, beginners, or family outings, automatic tents are recommended. ※ ?Are automatic aluminum frame tents better than those with fiberglass frames? ※ Automatic tents with aluminum frames are sturdier and have a longer lifespan. Fiberglass frames may cause splinters. For better quality, choose aluminum-framed tents. For casual park picnics, fiberglass frames can suffice. ※ ?What does the water pressure of tent fabric mean? How to choose? ※ Generally, tents have two layers: inner for ventilation and outer for rainproofing. The water pressure of outer tents is usually around PU2000mm, meaning the outer layer can withstand 2000mm vertical water pressure without leaking; higher numbers indicate better rainproof performance. A 2000mm water pressure rating is typically sufficient for medium to heavy rain. Tips: Vinyl coatings can improve the rainproof performance of the tent. ※ !! The tent in the video is a new stainless steel automatic tent. Never heard of it? Stainless steel automatic tents are sturdier and more durable than aluminum-framed ones. Traditional aluminum automatic tents might deform under strong winds or improper operation, making them hard to retract. Stainless steel solves this issue perfectly and offers a more high-end appearance. ※ Proven to work!! Proven to work!! Proven to work!!

Shen Congshu, after breaking up with her ex this year, somehow quickly started dating a young boyfriend... The boyfriend is five years younger and still in school. His looks are not something to mention, as anyone who sees him will definitely look back twice. Chivalrous and hardworking in the kitchen, obedient and accommodating, but overly enthusiastic at night... Besides occasionally struggling with the passion of a young man, Shen Congshu is very satisfied with her new boyfriend. The poor college student's life was occasionally alleviated by Shen Congshu secretly slipping him money or buying him gifts under various pretexts. Don't play dirty Contrary to others' predictions, six months passed, and Shen Congshu and her boyfriend were still a perfect match, without breaking up. Until one day, Shen Congshu had a reason to visit her boyfriend's university... Song Yue was playing basketball with others. From a distance, Shen Congshu observed his tall, fit stature, exceptional looks, and noticeable presence as he shot, blocked, and ran on the court. Only when the game ended and she prepared to greet him did she realize something was off. After the game, he was nothing like the always-smiling young man she knew at home. Surrounded at the center of a crowd, he had a cold face, lowered eyes, emanating an aura discouraging anyone from coming within ten meters—completely different from the person she had known for the past six months... Shen Congshu slowly stopped in her tracks: .....? As a well-known figure at University A, it didn’t take much effort for Shen Congshu to find out the truth.

        "content": "```\nQuery: Badminton arm exercises\nNote: Badminton training physical fitness can be referenced for training Playing badminton; Badminton; Sports #BadmintonTeaching[Topic]# #BadmintonTraining[Topic]# #BadmintonPro[Topic]# #Badminton[Topic]# #Sports[Topic]# #DailyBallSports[Topic]# #PhysicalTraining[Topic]# #PlayingBadminton[Topic]# Since most amateur players are latecomers and expect to quickly join games with others, distinguishing from traditional training methods, you might focus on techniques that are easier for you to grasp and break through your understanding after mastering some basic skills, rather than blindly following the mainstream training. This approach makes it easier to highlight your strengths and form your gameplay style earlier, laying a foundation for subsequent training. Firstly, basic training is indispensable for laying a foundation for comprehensive skills development later. High clear hit power, net drop control, and lifting shots are essential to learn before focusing on elective techniques that interest you. Secondly, the purpose of training is to master a full range of skills and the continuity between them. Focusing on only one skill can quickly lead to a bottleneck. This article provides suggestions from mid-term training and early competitive opposition perspectives (training through matches). It does not mean you can start experimenting recklessly after mastering a single skill. For players with quick foot movements and explosive strength, when choosing backcourt techniques, consider flat hits and fast drop kills first. Fast ball speed allows for quick advantage at high points. If you can execute small hops instinctively, there's no need to rigidly follow traditional footwork for every active stroke. Note that this aggressive style must accompany excellent core strength. Strengthen or learn to use your abs and waist muscles, as without proper balance, any advantage during leaps will be wasted. 2. Strong upper limb strength. Regarding upper limb strength, we discuss the chest, arms, and shoulders as an interrelated power system. If one area is strong while the others lack balance, it risks injury. These three parts need to achieve a balanced development, like the 1:1:1 ratio of Golden Dragonfish soybean oil. Strong upper limb players might consider practicing drive shots, which rely less on rotation power and more on sheer power. For mid-range flat drives or rear lifts shots, this becomes your strong area, allowing you to suppress opponents widely. To maximize upper limb advantage, train thigh muscles for stability during standing shots. 3. Exceptional waist and core strength. Amateur badminton players rarely reach this level of waist ability. However, if you naturally excel, develop close-net play after mastering active and passive high clear shots. Dominate net play to pressure others, forcing opportunities for attacking clears. Pairing waist effort with arm power creates an unstoppable precision and speed impact. 4. Strong thigh muscles. Good lower body strength ensures balance during battles. Players with strong legs usually dominate mid-court tussles or execute full-range plays post-smash techniques. Such conditioning matches transitions and flexibility without tiring joint networks easily. Regarding mixed doubles requiring back-hand transitioning, utilize thighs harder toward advanced burst threshold! 5. Finger/wrist finesse. Finger dexterity handles misdirected angles fluidly. Avoid stressed risky outright spins early—dedicated practices support wider improvisations kneaded better throughout functional attacks. Expectation lies toward diligence favoring controlled subtleties overlooking simplistic premature boast aesthetics contrary rectifying flaws instead reaching consistency/reset periodic adherence corrections farewell stylist temptations misleading exploits unfortunately painful stationary discontents week alerts stated evaluated correctional promising variable trial-life verified outlining summarized advancements plusnicely aligned incentives key-advised-user transitional dynamic technically configurations eventually special consistency philosophies meantime gradual programmatic instruction faithfully adhering userspecialized versions respect honest practical-process discovery route implementations fulfillment playingdream skilledpro-ground fundamentals forthcoming synthesized goals! over```",

Actually, Australia only has a few major cities, some are too small, and others too far away. Most people are familiar with Sydney and Melbourne. Sydney is somewhat like Shanghai, with a fast pace of life, high housing prices, and is absolutely a bustling metropolis. However, cities with such attributes feel similar and lack novelty. Melbourne, on the other hand, is Australia's cultural capital, the capital of sports, and exudes a refined, sophisticated charm. It offers a unique allure found nowhere else in the world and provides a completely different living experience. Even if you live in the city center, within a 30-minute drive, you can reach beaches and forests. Walking through the city with a cup of coffee, you'll experience an air of classical elegance that spans a century. It’s very comfortable, and it’s no exaggeration to say that once you have lived here for a while, you will clearly understand why this city, the most livable in the world, truly lives up to its reputation.\n```",

Script Murder; Story; Mastering Script Murder\nIntroduction to the story of \"Wind Blowing Waves of Wheat\" Script Murder: ※ This is a sinful fugue, about the loss of love and the death of heart. It is a romantic hardcore script, where you might even feel touched. Wind blowing through waves of wheat, seeds of revenge planted, amidst the golden waves, will the survivor be an angel or a demon?\n※ Starting from a shared memory of a high school girl's suicide case, 4 old cases and 6 serial wheatfield murder cases intertwine, and the memories of 6 people propel the reasoning process forward.\n※ \"Wind Blowing Waves of Wheat\" Script Murder Story Review:\n※ Beizaki once saw two boys (one of them liked Xiaomei) escort Xiaomei home. They were Takahiro Nakamura and Taro Yayoi.\n※ [The real culprit's motive for killing Koizumi and Aoki]\n※ i: Before proving this point, players Iga, Shota, and Beizaki need to break a deceptive perspective in their scripts. Beizaki, in October 2008, saw two boys escorting Xiaomei home (Xiaomei also told Beizaki one of them liked her). Meanwhile, Shogi and Iga, during the same month, escorted Xiaomei home once, and saw a sullen-faced guy wearing glasses near her house.\n※ If the three carefully examine the perspective in their scripts, they will find inconsistencies. Firstly, Iga and Shota saw the boy near Xiaomei's house, not at her door, while Beizaki saw Xiaomei at her door. Moreover, a week after Beizaki saw the two boys, Xiaomei vanished. Xiaomei disappeared two days after Iga and Shota escorted her home. The timelines do not match. This implies that the ones Beizaki saw were not Shota and Iga, and vice versa.\n※ So, who is this sullen-faced, glasses-wearing guy? Ayane's script mentions that in 2008, when her family would visit each other, Xiaomei often drew sketches of a sullen-faced guy (although handsome, his features seemed off and resembled Beizaki). This indicates that the sullen-faced guy is someone else. Noriko's viewpoint also mentions that during Yayoi Taro's part-time job at a deli, a boy wearing glasses worked with him (Takahiro Nakamura). This shows Nakamura Takahiro wore glasses. Additionally, since Beizaki saw two boys, if they were neither Shota nor Iga, it's highly likely they were Yayoi Taro and Takahiro Nakamura. Among them, Nakamura Takahiro also liked Xiaomei (of course, at that age, \"liking\" might mean viewing Xiaomei as a sister or a youthful innocent crush). If this is the case, everything makes sense, and it explains Nakamura Takahiro's motive for retaliating against the two kidnappers. But from the players' current perspective, they can most confirm there were two groups of two boys who escorted Xiaomei home. How can we prove that Nakamura Takahiro and Yayoi Taro were that other group?\n※ To address this, we need to supplement the following logic chain ii.\nii: As mentioned earlier, due to police confidentiality\n※\n※ This article provides partial spoilers and a retrospective review of the truth from \"Wind Blowing Waves of Wheat\" Script Murder.

We ate at Fengji BBQ, spending 140 yuan for two people. The taste was average, as the meat didn't feel very fresh since we went at night. We also tried Chuanniang Style Jelly (lots of people queuing) and Ye Popo's Spicy Skewers. ※ 👉Day 2: Take a direct taxi to Leshan Giant Buddha. Referring to others' guides, we took a taxi directly to Parking Lot No. 6 (no need to go to the Tourist Center, which might lead to encountering many tricycle operators who could charge higher prices). It's just a few minutes' walk to the Leshan Giant Buddha entrance. ※   Note: Purchase tickets online in advance. Student tickets cost only 10 yuan (graduate students are also eligible). Once there, you will need to exchange for a physical ticket on-site. ※ 👉Day 3: Take the high-speed train from Leshan Station to Mount Emei Station (only 11 yuan/person; note that it's not Emei Station). Determine your accommodation based on your travel time. We arrived late and stayed at the foot of Mount Emei (Weishe Xiyue Inn, located 200 meters within a residential area from the reception; it seems newly renovated). ※ 👉Day 4: Depart at 8:00 AM by taxi🚗 to Qingyin Pavilion (Didi cost about 30 yuan, plus an additional 30 yuan because the driver claimed he would be returning with an empty car; mountain roads are winding). ※   Note: Plan your Emei climbing route ahead of time based on your preferences. Refer to the route below👇. ※ We chose the following route: Qingyin Pavilion - through the Ecological Monkey Zone to Hongchunping - through Jiushidaoguai to Xianfeng Temple - Yuxian Temple - Jiulinggang - Washing Elephant Pool - Leidongping - Golden Summit ※ 9:00 AM start from Qingyin Pavilion, reached Leidongping at 8:04 PM. ※ Along the way, we walked, played, and interacted with monkeys. Enjoyed very cool water and encountered three different kinds of monkeys. They were very spirited and cute. ※   Note: This route includes many steep slopes. A bamboo stick is a must-buy as a walking stick. It is sold at Qingyin Pavilion for five yuan each and is highly, highly, highly recommended!!! ※ Initially, we planned to go directly to the Golden Summit, but by the time we reached Leidongping, it was very late and we were exhausted, so we decided to stay overnight. Accommodation prices are above 500 yuan (if you plan to go directly to the Golden Summit, consider starting from Wannian Temple as it's slightly easier). ※   Note: The temperature at Leidongping is relatively low, so bring a light down jacket or windbreaker (there are coats available for rent for 50 yuan within 48 hours). 👉Day 5: Get up at 4:30 AM to watch the sunrise. ※   Note: The sunrise is around 6:30 AM. It takes about 20 minutes on foot from Leidongping to the cableway, which starts operating at 5:30 AM. Decide your departure time based on whether you are taking the cableway or walking. The cableway ride is a few minutes, while walking takes about an hour and a half. ※ Witnessing the entire sunrise process was truly breathtaking and beautiful, making everything worth it. ~ ※ As young people, we chose the Yixiantian direction, covering about 50 km in total.

As a precaution, it’s best used in areas not frequently touched by children, pets, or guests, such as master bedrooms.\n```",

Leaders at these events don't like pretty women but those who know how to play their cards right. ※ 1. Leader says: You really spent a lot today. At this time, ※ don't say: It’s fine, it's not much. This tone might make the other person feel belittled or disrespected, and they'll think you’re not sincere, thus devaluing the meal's worth. ※ Instead, try saying: Mr. Wang, it's an honor to dine with you. This meal is just a token. Let's meet more often in the future so I can continue learning from you. ※ Place the other person in a higher position, fulfilling both material and emotional expectations, ensuring they view you more favorably. ※ 2. Leader says: You ordered so many dishes, you're being too generous. ※ Don't respond with: Not much, if it's not enough, we can order more. This gives the impression you're financially reckless, potentially inviting trouble. Someone unscrupulous might seize the opportunity, and you'll end up at a loss. ※ The correct response: Mr. X, you’re so busy and it's not easy to meet you. It's a rare treat to have you here. I’m not sure if these dishes suit your taste; please accept my humble hospitality. ※ This conveys sincerity, making them feel comfortable and more inclined to meet with you again. ※ 3. The other person says: I didn't expect you could handle your alcohol so well. At this point, don't humbly say: Oh no, just average, not that great. ※ Next time, you can respond: Mr. X, you flatter me. I'm not a strong drinker, but dining with you today makes me so happy that I drank more than usual. ※ 4. Don't let compliments go to your head; respond appropriately. When seniors at the table say, \"Xiao Li, I toast to you! In the future, I'm sure we’ll need your help! You'll have to take care of things then!\" ※ Don't casually say: No problem, just let me know. ※ Though it might seem fine, this response is too ordinary. ※ The correct approach is to flatter in return: You overestimate me. I’d undoubtedly go through fire and water if needed. In the future, we’ll still rely on your guidance in our work! ※ Flatter those in higher positions. Though they’re showing humility, don’t forget the status gap. When big issues arise, they won't actually need you. You should return the praise, putting them back in their rightful position, making them feel you’re considerate. ※ 5. When your own leader praises you in front of others by saying: Xiao Zhang is a top talent in our department, always reliable. At this point, don't say: Not at all. That would be tantamount to embarrassing the leader, insinuating they lack judgment. Understand the leader's underlying message and ensure you respond appropriately. ※ Remember the formula: Express gratitude + return praise. For example: Thank you, boss. It’s all thanks to your excellent guidance. Without your patient teaching, I wouldn’t be who I am today. At this point, you can also stand up and offer a toast. This will ensure you leave a high emotional intelligence impression in their eyes. Being articulate at social gatherings will make leaders look at you in a new light. #IfYouDontUnderstandAskAndAnswer[Topic]# #SocialWisdom[Topic]# #SelfImprovement[Topic]# #SocialGathering[Topic]# #FemaleGrowth[Topic]# #HighEmotionalIntelligence[Topic]# #Appearance[Topic]#\n```",

South Korea has no concept of a 70-year property right. If we were South Koreans, we would also hope that the houses we worked hard to purchase wouldn’t be affected by property rights issues. Therefore, it’s inevitable that many houses are old and worn out; the owner's intentions take precedence. ※ 3. Convenience stores and well-known restaurant brands are common in rural areas. ※ 4.

        "content": "```\nQuery: When a guy says 'Alright then'\nNote: Hermes; Boyfriend Four truths that make guys unwilling to give! ※ ※ Most guys, after making an effort for you, feel like they've made an impulsive expense. This is one of the reasons why guys are less willing to give over time. Some guys might feel that, after being overly praised by a girl yesterday, they impulsively bought her a Hermes, but wake up the next day regretting it, thinking they were too hasty in spending. This is the same as when a girl buys a lipstick today and wants to return it the next day, a sense of regret after the purchase. This is the first point. ※ ※ A guy’s effort at the time is genuine, but since it involves hard-earned money, don’t assume it’s a given. Also, a guy's spending on a girl is proportional to his previous month's income, and it has little to do with feelings of love. If someone is willing to spend on you, they're sacrificing their own benefit to love you. For instance, if I buy you clothes today, the money I used could’ve been spent on getting myself a new phone. If I cover your living expenses today, that money could’ve raised my own living standards. ※ ※ How to reduce the impulsive spending mindset in men? ※ ※ The broken window theory: make him feel like he's saving money. For example, if you want your boyfriend to take you to a nearby park, you can first propose a bigger request. Say: Honey, I want to go to Hainan for a vacation. Your boyfriend might respond, 'That's so far, I’m busy with work now... etc.' Then you can understandingly say: Fine, I understand you’re so busy, how about we just go to a nearby park instead? At this point, your boyfriend will likely agree happily, seeing you as considerate. But your initial plan all along was simply to visit the nearby park. ※ ※ The second point is that it’s not always that men are unwilling to spend on you, but that you may not align with their spending habits. Most men don’t care about a girl’s income but do care if her spending habits align with theirs. For instance, a guy might initially want to spend on a girl, but if he notices she spends extravagantly, no matter how well-off he is, he’ll worry about sustaining it long-term and hesitate to give more. People are willing to give with the hope of receiving some return. ※ ※ How to resolve this? ※ We first need to guide them in areas they’re good at and then guide them toward areas they’re less skilled in. For example, if a guy is great at cooking, you can first encourage him to cook for you. Cooking is something he’s good at and willing to do. When he has invested time and effort into it, a sunk cost occurs, making him more prone to offering other types of contributions. People are happy to dedicate themselves in areas they excel in. For instance, if someone is good at talking, you can engage in conversations daily, letting him give you advice or solve problems for you without noticing. Over time, as he invests resources, he will naturally hope for reciprocation. At this stage, asking for him to sacrifice in other areas might be more acceptable. But if you directly start by asking for what you want or trying to take, he might want to keep his distance from you. ※ ※ ※\n```",

The built-in resources are also great. Here I emphasize again: For kindergarten senior class and above, you must choose the Lele customized version, which includes Lele Classroom system courses (shared in previous notes), simulating offline teaching modes with a learning-practice-test closed loop, offering both in-school reinforcement and out-of-school expansion, an amazing course[Thumbupr] ※ Grade range: kindergarten, elementary, junior, high school (RAZ English grading, Kada Chinese grading, Dou Shen series, New Oriental series) ※ ※ 🌱BOE c2 ※ Features: 10.1 inches, compact but fully functional. If you haven’t used an eye-protecting tablet and have a budget of just over 1000, go for it. Built-in resources are fewer than a1s, but its main selling point is cost-effectiveness (what more could you ask for[LOLr]) ※ Grade range: kindergarten, elementary ※ ※ 🌱Xiaodu Gaosi Edition ※ Features: 13.3 inches, circular polarized light eye protection technology, backed by Baidu's intelligent OS system, strong voice AI that can answer your questions anytime, followed by a small explanatory video. If your child scores between 95-100 in school math and has a foundation in Olympia Math, the Gaosi Edition is very suitable. ※ Grade range: kindergarten, elementary, junior ※ ※ 🌱Seewo v1pro ※ Features: This is actually a smaller version of Seewo w2 (refer to previous note for w2 evaluation). As the pandemic opened up, the demand for portable tablets increased, so Seewo introduced this model. The built-in content and screen quality are comparable to the 15.6-inch version but includes Tsinghua Peking remote courses, which are very friendly for junior high students. ※ Grade range: elementary, junior ※ ※ 🌱Xiaoyuan Learning Training Machine ※ Features: Black-and-white e-ink screen, similar to reading paper, mainly focuses on in-school synchronization with explanations, mostly exercises, chapter tests, and unit tests, with automatic corrections and error recording, promoting learning through practice. Technically not a learning machine but complements them well. ※ Grade range: elementary, junior ※ ※ Also a Listening Bear AI reading book, not a learning machine, but for reading purposes, comes with RAZ to practice English. With so many brands, choosing one suitable for your child, Mom Li will guide you to use it, making it worth it no matter what!

First, sneakers. I highly recommend New Balance's 2002R and 574 series for wide feet. I wear size 40. After comparing many similar styles, their shoes can make our big feet look more delicate. I've been pairing 2002RC with many looks since October. What surprised me is its sleek shoe shape. When looking down, it doesn't make the feet appear wide at all. If you're like me and love black, blue, and gray clothes, you'll find this shoe very versatile. Its sole is made of durable rubber with strong ground grip and wear resistance, and it has a 4-cm heel lift. The upper is a combination of suede and mesh, which isn't ideal for the cold, windy winters in the north, but works well in the warmer south, suitable for all seasons except the hottest. The 574 series is a classic from New Balance, and it makes feet look even smaller and more delicate than the 2002R. Whether with jeans or skirts, it offers a casual yet refined vibe. The upper is made of woven fabric, providing better wind resistance. Their signature ENCAP midsole offers great shock absorption. These lightweight shoes are super easy to walk in. If your wardrobe features more brown tones, I recommend trying out the gray and brown-tail version for higher utility. If you prefer black, gray, and blue tones, the other pair will complement your outfits better. Their design is beautifully detailed. A specific pair of German training shoes caught my eye for two reasons: first, its soft and gentle beige tone that looks elegant and clean on the feet; second, its strong suede texture combined with color-rubbed leather for a rugged yet casual vibe. The design of the front of the shoe enhances the look of elegance compared to standard rounded German training shoes; this has a slightly square toe. Pairing it with flared or wide-leg trousers creates an aura of elegance and strength. Sizing runs large by half a size. I usually wear size 40, which felt loose; size 39 was simply too small. Adding an insole for winter is a good option. These German training shoes share a dainty shoe shape with the black-tailed pair I mentioned this summer. They also have a durable rubber sole and provide great comfort. The upper is made of densely packed wool, making it soft and warm. The price during live streams is 407, offering great value for money. Another recommendation is the loafers with a sophisticated silhouette. The square-toe design has an academic look but doesn’t make the feet appear big, perfect for pairing with dresses. The upper is made of soft hand-grabbed sheepskin with an appealing gloss. The heel height is about 3.5 cm, with a durable and slip-resistant rubber sole. However, size 40 felt slightly tight for me, so I recommend going up half a size. Compared to my previous Martin boots, this pair stands out for its refined shape. Despite my foot being 10 cm wide, this fits just right. It lacks the bulky appearance of typical Martin boots, making it more versatile for pairing with skirts. The upper is crafted from soft calfskin leather, offering a nice sheen. The lining and insole are full leather, ensuring excellent moisture absorption and breathability. The rubber sole provides incredible comfort. For those with even wider forefeet, I suggest the Chelsea boots in the lineup. I've worn these for over three months with no visible wear and tear. They're durable and extremely comfortable. The forefoot width is slightly broader than the Martin boots, offering a much better fit. The upper is also made of calfskin leather with small pores for a fine texture and shine. Full leather lining and insoles ensure excellent rebound, and the rubber sole is perfect for long walks with no discomfort. \n```",

How to do RAZ leveled reading; leveled reading RAZ; Hermès; phonics; reading. Starting from the end of May last year, I began guiding Xiye to go through this set of RAZ leveled readers. Almost a year later, we've progressed from level AA and just finished level I yesterday. Some say it's rapid progress, but for top-notch kids, it's not considered fast. However, we have moved along smoothly without hitting any level bottlenecks. ※ Today I'll share our valuable experiences with a detailed summary, first summarized in eight words: extensive reading + selective intensive reading. If your child is starting from zero in English or encounters obstacles while doing RAZ, then make sure to watch this video thoroughly. It's recommended to like and save the video to avoid losing it by accident. ※ I regard RAZ as the Hermès of leveled reading. In my mind, its status is unparalleled. Over 50% of public schools in the U.S. and Canada use it for reading. From level AA to Z1Z2, this complete system includes two to three thousand books, truly a vocabulary treasure. Completing the entire set can build a vocabulary of 20,000+ words. ※ Below, I'll share some tips on reading through the 27 levels and the four key points for each level. ※ Point one: Extensive listening and reading at lower levels. ※ Take care not to linger too long; move quickly. The goal at lower levels is to ensure comprehensible input and vocabulary building. ※ Many parents ask me, \"We've spent a week on level AA and still can't remember the content or recite it. Why remember? Why recite? It's not as if the child is going to give a speech.\" ※ Secondly, when should we take reading seriously? ※ I mentioned the three-pass method in a previous video. If the child cannot read fluently during the second pass, integrate the Ebbinghaus memory method to aid learning. Meanwhile, regardless of the three-pass method, keep advancing. Do not stop. ※ Note two levels, B and E. These are common bottlenecks where many children may struggle to advance. For these levels, take extra care when reading during the second pass. If the process becomes overly difficult, try lateral strategies, finding other leveled materials that interest the child to build confidence and aid transition. Never rush forward purely for speed, as maintaining interest is always the top priority. No need to compete with top-performing kids. ※ Third point: Adding phonics at the D level. ※ Many parents ask when to introduce phonics. Apart from the two-month guideline suggested in my child education plan, it's unwise to start before reaching a vocabulary of 1,000+ words, especially with limited daily study time. Thus, RAZ's D level is the benchmark for introducing phonics. ※ Fourth point: Combining intensive and extensive reading at the J level. ※ At this point, pay extra attention to intensive reading. Since Xiye began reading at the J level last week, I also plan to combine intensive and extensive reading, using the Ebbinghaus memory method to assist. If you encounter any issues with progressing through RAZ levels, feel free to leave a comment, and I will respond to each one. #EveryMomentIsWorthRecording #AdvancedEnglishEducation #BeginnerEnglish #RAZ #LeveledReadingRAZ #LeveledReading #HowToGoThroughRAZ... ```",

Finalized the character traits and developed their appearance further based on their personality. Designed four short hairstyles: The first and third are common short haircuts; the second has a mature, womanly vibe, and the fourth has a more neutral and cool style. The above details are results of discussions with friends on the 14th.

Currently working as a market analyst at Bell in Canada. Despite having no local Canadian internship experience, I received 7 first-round interview invitations and 4 final-round interviews within a month (out of 40 companies applied to). This proves that the idea of North American companies ignoring non-local internship experiences is unfounded. A well-written resume can help you succeed without local experience. I'll share my resume writing strategies and tips; feel free to discuss in the comments! ※ ※ 1. Educational Background ※ Include school attended, degree and major, graduation date, and achievements during school (e.g., dean's honor list; scholarships) ※ 1. Highlight GPA if it's high. Not all companies require GPA for interns, but a high GPA definitely adds value to your resume as it reflects strong learning and quick adaptability skills. ※ 2. For students with graduate school offers, include the graduate school, degree, and a list of upcoming courses. ※ ※ 2. Work Experience (select 3 key points): ※ A resume is not better with more content but with relevant experiences aligned to the desired job position. For example, experience in auditing at big four firms won't necessarily be more impactful for a fast-moving consumer goods market role compared to small company marketing experience. ※ 1. Be concise: Each point should be 1-2 lines, focusing on what you did and the results achieved. HRs review hundreds of resumes daily and usually spend less than a minute on each. Thus, keywords and precise content are critical. ※ 2. Tangible results: Each segment of work experience should include not just good results but also show how your work contributed to the company's objectives. For example, increased sales by xx%, improved ROI, enhanced client satisfaction, or attracted xxx new customers. Quantified descriptions directly showcase how your past accomplishments can advance future company goals. ※ ※ 3. Extracurricular Activities: ※ 1. Leadership experiences to demonstrate diverse skills ※ 2. School projects, e.g., group projects/personal research ※ Longer projects > Short-term projects Emphasize leadership, teamwork, time management, and communication skills ※ ※ ! Notes: ※ 1. North American resumes do not require photos to avoid appearance-based discrimination. ※ 2. Keep the resume style clean and simple, with white background and black text (no fancy fonts or colorful borders). ※ 3. Content should not exceed one page. ※ 4. Resume naming format: first name+last name+position applied (optional) ※ #Resume [topic]# #Internship [topic]# #Resume writing [topic]# #University student resume [topic]# #Toronto [topic]# #Canada Internships [topic]# #North American Job Search [topic]# #Top Company Internships [topic]# @Campus Potato @Little Red Book Growth Assistant 0 local experience, landed North American top-company offers. HRs review hundreds of resumes daily and usually spend less than 1 minute on each. Thus, the key is to include the keywords they want to see and deliver precise and relevant content. 2. Tangible results: Each segment of work experience should not only yield good outcomes but also demonstrate the tangible value you brought to your work.

Regarding bride price, Fujian people prefer sons, but they also treat daughters well. When daughters get married, even though the bride price is higher than in Jiangxi, it is given to the daughters, along with additional money and gold. A woman from Fujian received a bride price of 500,000 yuan, gold worth 100,000 yuan, and her parents gifted a car worth 500,000 yuan as dowry. The bride price and gold were all for the couple. Many weddings in the Jinjiang area feature brides adorned with gold. They would never withhold their daughter's bride price but instead hope for a happy marriage for the couple. Girls are not required to start working after middle school to earn money for their brothers' house. Fujian people value the education of daughters, allowing them to study as much as possible. One rural girl who got into a top-tier university received a total of 13,000 yuan in awards: 5,000 yuan from her own village clan, 5,000 yuan from the village itself, and 3,000 yuan from her grandmother's village. Fujian people have a tradition of entrepreneurship—founders of Bytedance and Meituan are both from Longyan, Fujian. They not only run businesses domestically but also set up companies overseas. For instance, one Fujianese in Germany operates three companies in a city, focusing on photovoltaics. Fujian people are sharp-eyed; wherever opportunities arise, they establish their presence. They are affluent yet conscientious, value sons, treat daughters well, and believe family harmony leads to success.\n```",

Transaminase: When liver cells experience inflammation, toxicity, necrosis, etc., liver cells become damaged, and transaminase is released into the blood, causing elevated serum transaminase levels. ※ Normal transaminase values are between 0~40 u/l. ※ Transaminase levels between 40~80 u/l indicate moderate elevation. ※ Transaminase levels between 80~200 u/l indicate significant elevation. ※ Transaminase levels exceeding 200 u/l are considered severely elevated. ※ Generally speaking, transaminase levels exceeding 40 u/l may be caused by liver damage, including liver cell necrosis or degeneration. ※ If even 1% or more liver cells die, the amount of ALT (alanine aminotransferase) will double. ※ Therefore, ALT is an important marker for detecting liver damage. If ALT levels in the body are elevated, it indicates potential liver issues. ※ Mastering three tricks for scientific enzyme reduction: ※ Identify the cause ※ If transaminase levels are elevated, especially more than twice the normal value, blindly reducing enzymes is not recommended. Instead, further diagnosis should be conducted, focusing on hepatitis B, hepatitis C, fatty liver, etc. ※ Symptomatic treatment ※ After identifying the cause of elevated transaminase levels, treat the primary disease accordingly. When necessary, liver-protecting treatments can be administered to normalize transaminase levels. ※ Correct bad habits ※ In addition to treatment, maintaining healthy lifestyle and dietary habits is key to reducing transaminase levels. ※ First, maintain a regular schedule and ensure adequate sleep; ※ Second, eat a balanced diet with a mix of meat and vegetables, low oil and low salt, and light meals; ※ Lastly, engage in moderate exercise. Choosing an activity that can be sustained long-term will enhance physical fitness and provide sufficient liver care. ※ Do not ignore elevated transaminase levels, as prolonged negligence can lead to increasingly severe liver damage.

How many of you have experienced placing and removing an IUD? It’s so painful [facepalm]. I had it placed twice and removed twice. ※ The first time was one year after giving birth to my daughter, which was an unplanned pregnancy. Since it was a C-section, it carried risks; after the surgery, I chose an IUD without anesthesia— felt painful, painful, painful. I remember the doctor said it would last 5 years, but after 10 years, my menstrual periods became longer, and I finally gathered the courage to remove it. Because the first IUD had a small tail, it was relatively easy to remove. However, when expanding the cervical opening, the pain was incredibly unbearable. ※ Over these ten years, I had persistent lower back pain, which might be related to the C-section. A CT scan showed a herniated lumbar disc. After removing the IUD, my periods returned to normal, and surprisingly, my back pain also reduced significantly. After much indecision and fear of unplanned pregnancies, I decided to get another IUD a few months later. This time, the doctor recommended a copper IUD with a medication layer to prevent inflammation, uterine fibroids, and other issues. Once again, the procedure was done without anesthesia—it was incredibly painful, trembling all over, and I couldn’t stop crying. The copper IUD was large, and my uterine opening was very narrow. After several failed attempts, the doctor finally called in an anesthetist for pain relief. I advise sisters: if you must get an IUD, please request anesthesia. If not necessary, please don’t go through this—it’s too torturous. My suffering didn’t end. After the placement, my severe back pain returned. Two months later, I decided to have it removed again. Without scheduling in advance and having eaten lunch, anesthesia was not an option for the day. Due to time constraints, I had the IUD removed directly without anesthesia. The pain was real, but thankfully, the doctor was gentle and skillfully removed the flesh-covered IUD. I swear I’ll never have another one! #IUD [Hashtag]# #Remove IUD [Hashtag]#\n```",

I really don't recommend couples moving in too early, no matter how good the relationship is now, it won't work. Among the couples around me who quickly moved in together, few have good outcomes. Yes, there are many benefits to living together: you can stick together every day, reduce longing for each other, and enjoy a shameless life every night... But ideals are rich, and reality is not only bone-chilling but cruel... At first, maybe the first week is fine, but as time goes on, you'll increasingly find: this is simply the beginning of a disaster. Do you know why? Because your cohabitation destroys one of the most essential things at the start of a relationship — space. What is space in a relationship? In simple terms, it means not getting too close too soon in the beginning to avoid ruining your relationship and your beautiful imaginations about each other. Do you think your guy or girl is absolutely perfect? Haha...their college dorm roommates know all too well what their pigsty looks like. Do you think your guy or girl is absolutely perfect? Haha...their college dorm roommates know all too well what their pigsty looks like. Your prince charming might hoard dirty socks and underwear until he has no clean ones left before dumping them all into the washing machine at once; your dream boy might go back home as a gaming addict, wearing only underwear, smoking, with half-eaten spicy hot pot spilling broth all over his desk; your fairy-tale princess might wear a different outfit every time you meet, but that's because she throws all her clothes into a pile and picks randomly to wear—if it weren't for meeting you, her biggest hobby would be lying on the bed in disarray, munching chips with her legs crossed watching TV... You feel great about each other now because your time together is limited, and your understanding of each other is still stuck on the beautiful side. But cohabitation is different; it's almost full exposure to the other's life. Forget maintaining an image—you won't last for months pretending. This image collapse is just one aspect. Have you considered the differences that come with clashing habits? Differing perspectives between couples are already a significant shock, and it's worse when lifestyle habits need adjustments. In the past, even when negative emotions arose, it was easy to dissolve them before meeting or communicating. But now, you come home only to face a partner filled with emotions. Moreover, trivial domestic issues easily trigger conflicts. Back when my girlfriend and I lived together, even arguments arose over what seasoning to use in a dish—was it a big deal? No, it just became a trigger. Naturally, conflicts occur while interacting. These could be resolved slowly, but under the same roof, there's no time to process those emotions. Now imagine your simmering frustration compounded by differences in daily habits—it’s like pouring oil on a fire, intensifying what would have been subdued disputes. Essentially, the issue of early cohabitation boils down to emotional preparedness.\n```",

I also gained a lot of theoretical and model-building knowledge through CQF, which landed me a ticket to enter the industry. ※ 2 Vague career planning ※ Previously, I worked in the internet sector doing mathematical analysis and algorithms, then transitioned to quantitative finance. Honestly, it involved sacrificing a lot of sunk costs. If you want to switch to quantitative finance, engaging more with professionals in the field is essential. I happened to meet many insiders during my CQF studies. ※ 3 Unclear job-seeking strategy ※ My previous resume and job-hunting strategies lacked focus. I suggest emphasizing coding and algorithm skills. For example: utilizing the xx framework to apply the xx model for xxx predictions. Always highlight data and metrics awareness~ ※ - ※ 📢What are the benefits of studying CQF? ※ CQF is still relatively niche, with only about 10,000 holders globally, most of whom are at institutions like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, HSBC, Citibank, UBS, etc. ※ - ※ 📢Outline of CQF content: ※  Exam 1: ※ Start the exam 2 weeks after completing Module 2, which covers the basics of quantitative finance and risk-reward calculations, including portfolio allocation, products and market risks, and binomial tree options pricing models. ※  Exam 2: ※ Start the exam immediately after completing Module 3, lasting 2 weeks, with 3 questions. My exam included topics that later introduced some data and machine learning content. ※  Exam 3: ※ I deferred the exam, which involved constructing a machine learning model. ※  Final Project: ※ Earning the CQF certificate is not hard~5 topics to choose from, like portfolio optimization and deep learning.

It's suggested not to rent a car🚘 unless necessary, because along Erhai's route, you can only use bicycles or shared electric scooters. Driving a car limits you to roads where the lake is not visible, and you'll need to park (fee required💰). Some comments mentioned that renting a car is possible on the East side to explore the line, decide based on your needs and be mindful~ ※ 2. Consider personal preferences on whether to rent a bicycle. Rentals require returning to the original spot! ※ My route: Took a bus from Dali Old Town to Xizhou, explored Xizhou Old Town, then took a three-wheeled scooter to Haixi Park. This is the starting point of Erhai Eco-Corridor, which has lots of shared electric scooters! You can pass through famous check-in spots and end at Caicun. Personally, I think two people should not share one scooter. ※ 👔 Gear ※ 1. A sun hat with a string! The wind at Erhai is really strong; without a string, you'll have to hold the hat while cycling or walking ※ 2. A breathable sun-protection mask! Normal masks aren't very breathable. I used a sun-protection mask; it smudges makeup a bit but is very breathable! Won't feel stuffy. ※ 3. Hand cream!! After cycling 3 hours along Erhai, my hands were super dry. Without hand cream, my skin felt like it would dry out fast ※ 🚗 Itinerary ※ My itinerary in Dali was: Dali Station, Dali Old Town, Caicun (accommodation), Xizhou, Long Bridge, Panxi S-Bend, Caicun ※ 1. After arriving at Dali High-Speed Rail Station, head right, go over the pedestrian bridge to the other side of the road, and take Bus 8 (apply for the Dali Bus Card in advance) for just 3r💰 to Dali Old Town! (Bus stop name: Dali East Gate) ※ 2. Stayed in Caicun to catch the sunrise early. Took a taxi from Old Town to Caicun, costing about 9r💰. The sunrise at Caicun is very convenient, and I didn’t go to Longkan Wharf. I watched it at the seaside of Caicun, with fewer people and beautiful scenery. ※ 3. Didn’t buy the 98r💰 tourist bus tickets as many attractions are quite similar.

Accuracy in shapes ※ As one form of modeling art, the concept of shapes in drawing always takes precedence. On a two-dimensional plane, the pursuit of re-constructing natural forms in a meaningful way is the eternal theme of drawing art. Like other types of drawing, the accuracy of shapes in a half-length sketch is fundamental, especially in beginner sketch exams. The accuracy of shapes reflects a beginner's overall quality and skill level. ※ 2. Natural dynamics ※ Like quick sketches, half-length sketches emphasize the dynamic features of the figure. While half-lengths don't include the entire body, movements of the torso and arms should create a natural, relaxed state that conveys typical meaning. If you neglect the distinct characteristics of the figure's movements and focus solely on rigid proportions, the result will be stiff and lifeless, lacking vibrancy. When sketching, emphasize dynamic distinctiveness, even exaggerating if necessary, rather than being rigid and dull. This is often a defining feature of outstanding artwork. ※ 3. Clear hierarchy ※ Compared to a head sketch, a half-length sketch covers more content, requiring attention to natural dynamics, distinct features, and the hierarchy of composition for a cohesive result. The subjectivity of the head must be maintained and well-detailed to lead the composition. Equal attention should be given to portraying the hands since, like the head, they hold rich expression essential for capturing the model's essence. Other parts like clothing should be simplified to save time. ※ 4. Simplified techniques ※ A half-length sketch is a significant challenge for beginners. It's more complex than a head sketch or still life drawing. Demonstrating skills acquired in head sketches, mastering hand-rendering, and simplifying clothing and structural details is crucial to completing a test piece within three hours. Employing techniques and principles of simplification, allocating time wisely, and prioritizing subject elements are key. Beyond focusing on the head and hands, other areas should be summarized, using lines to outline clothing and applying tonal values to emphasize depth and transitions. This approach is more efficient and conveys inner meaning better than filling the entire piece with tonal values. Excessive focus on shadow and texture often skims the surface, missing the essence. ※ 5. Complete effect ※ Like other sketches, achieving a cohesive overall effect is crucial for high scores in exams. Problems such as chaotic composition, reversed priorities, overly busy or dull areas can ruin the entire piece. To avoid these pitfalls, one must understand and apply methods that ensure compositional harmony and balance.\n```",

Come and create this Little Crybaby Rose Sweet Tea Makeup, pinky with a hint of broken feel, it's really sweet and full of vibe. First, to achieve a plump, camera-friendly makeup look, the face must be smoothed out, so choose a more hydrating concealer, especially as autumn and winter approach. Dab this salmon color on the back of your hand, use a brush to lightly pick up a small amount, bow your head to find the lowest sunken point, then gradually spread upward. Excuse me, where did my dark circles go? Next, apply foundation, using the same dabbing technique with highlight shades to draw a small triangle under the tear trough. Gradually spread it out, filling the grooves under the eyes; the same goes for the nasal base. For areas with freckles or blemishes like mine, directly use a concealer brush, dab the skin tone shade and apply it in a dabbing motion over a larger area. Now compare both sides; this side looks clean and smooth! The concealer doesn’t cake or stick much, so it won’t be dragged away by additional foundation steps. This clean, flawless base makeup lays the foundation for creating all kinds of translucent and photo-ready makeup looks. Lay a base on the eyelids and darken the outer corners. Use pink eyeshadow to draw the lower liner and bring out the aegyo-sal. Use a brown eyeliner to draw thin lower lashes and elongate the eyeliner outward. Naturally contour the nose and apply blush in a circular motion on the cheeks. Finish with lip glaze and the makeup is done. Come and recreate this Little School Bag Rose Sweet Tea Makeup look–pink, with a hint of broken feel, truly sweet and full of vibe. To achieve a plump and structured makeup look, focus on prepping the face by smoothing it out and choosing a more hydrating concealer as autumn and winter arrive. Dab this salmon shade onto the back of your hand, lightly tap with a brush, and find your deepest hollow while bowing your head, gradually spreading outward. Excuse me, where did my dark circles go? Continue with a base foundation, similar dabbing method, apply highlight under the tear trough in a triangle shape and gradually spread it out. Doing so helps fill the texture beneath the tear trough downwards; the nasal base follows the same method. Accentuate lower liner with pink eyeshadow and define aegyo-sal, use a brown eyeliner for the bottom lashes, elongate the line smoothly outward.

Smart full laser; myopia; myopia surgery. Today I went cycling to Junhewang Dazhang to buy something. On Jiudu Road's Chanhe Bridge, I had a collision and my eye was hit by an unidentified bug. Unfortunately, I wasn’t wearing sunglasses today. I didn’t dare rub my eye rashly and had to rush to the hospital where I had surgery for help. Fortunately, it was flushed out quickly. Although it has been half a year and I can handle it myself, I went to the hospital as a precaution. ※ Along the way, I’ll share some experiences from the past six months since my surgery. ※ First, I did personalized full laser correction, as noted in my pinned notes. On May 9th, I completed my follow-up, and my vision is good—1.2 in both eyes. The total cost was 13,356 yuan. ※ When I underwent evaluation, all methods were viable for me, but I chose Smart full laser rather than full-femtosecond or semi-femtosecond because I heard: 1) With femtosecond procedures, recovery was less than ideal for some people and led to frequent dry eye. 2) Although faster recovery is associated with femtosecond methods, I didn’t observe it. Both femtosecond options involve incisions; how much faster could it be with incisions? Full laser offers no incision, no pressure, no flap, and no scars. Why are soldiers recommended full laser correction? Think about it. ※ If finances are no issue, an intraocular lens implant might be the optimal choice. For a cost-effective approach, look more into full laser correction, although everyone’s situation varies. Full femto and semi-femto can also result in good recovery; it’s very individual-specific. ※ If your prescription is mild or your daily life isn’t affected, consider just getting quality glasses. ※ One month post-surgery, I experienced slight irritation, not really dryness—a feeling like something was in my eye. When I went for a follow-up, I asked if it was dry eye, but it wasn’t. After switching eye drops and using them for four days, the symptoms disappeared. Up until now, all follow-ups over six months showed no further issues—quite lucky. ※ Before surgery, I read about failed cases shared by others, as well as reports of various post-surgical symptoms. It took me a long time to decide because, frankly, it’s a gamble. Some have no symptoms, while others face fluctuating vision, dry eye, or poor recovery. At follow-ups, I met others who had undergone similar procedures; those who followed doctors' orders recovered well. One young recruit undergoing full laser correction had dry eye and poor recovery because he smoked against medical advice. So, these surgeries are indeed very individual-specific—not as scary as many believe. ※ Post-surgery care advice is already in my pinned notes; feel free to read. ※ As I always say, if you have a real need, visit multiple hospitals, converse with other post-op patients during follow-ups, and ask questions. Such individuals are more reliable than any promotional claims—including myself!!!! If it’s not urgent, just focus on proper myopia prevention, get quality glasses, and that’s it!!!! ※ #SmartFullLaser[topic]# #MyopiaSurgery[topic]# #PostMyopiaSurgery[topic]# #MyopiaSunglasses[topic]# #LuoyangLocal[topic]# #AskAnything[topic]# Today I had an accident; it surfaced as soft adhesive lenses… A crack sound—becoming a May collector >> PM10 excess pollution; reduce outdoor activity and wear masks when going out. Today while cycling to Junhewang’s Dazhang, my eye hit an unknown bug on Jiudu Road River Bridge. Unfortunately, I wasn’t wearing sunglasses today. I didn’t dare rub violently and rushed to the surgeon’s hospital for help. Luckily, it was quickly resolved. Although half a year has passed and I could technically handle it myself, I went as a precaution. Along the way, sharing my 6-month journey. Initially opting for personalized full laser kept detailed pinned notes. May 9th’s latest follow-up: both eyes scored 1.2. Evaluated all methods; opted against femto options. Efficiency versus minor known setbacks (recoveries, dryness…). Pinned notes for curious insights. Hahaha!\n```",

Summer; Sun umbrella; Umbrella for both sunny and rainy days; Parasol; Anti-UV umbrella; Sun protection isolation 🌞 Summer is here, and choosing a good sun umbrella is a must! However, there are so many types of sun umbrellas on the market. How should you choose? Below are some tips for selecting a sun umbrella! ※ ※ 👉Fabric: The fabric of the umbrella is very important. Common types include regular nylon, sunproof coating, and silver coating. Regular nylon umbrellas are lightweight but don't provide good sun protection; black-coated umbrellas have excellent sun protection but are more expensive; silver-coated umbrellas have good sun protection but crack and peel under strong sunlight exposure. Therefore, choosing the right one based on your needs is very important. ※ 👉Umbrella ribs: The sturdiness of the umbrella ribs is a key factor in determining the quality of a sun umbrella. When buying, you can open the umbrella, hold the handle, and shake it left and right to check whether the frame wobbles noticeably and whether it’s solid and reliable. ※ 👉Index: The quality of a sun umbrella mainly depends on the UV protection index, which should reach upf > 40 and uva transmittance < 5%. The higher the upf value and the lower the uva value, the better the sun protection. ※ ※ [Read more] In summary, choosing a good sun umbrella needs to consider the fabric, frame, and index comprehensively. Feel free to [Red Heart] + [Star] or interact in the comment section. ※ ※ #SunscreenTips[Topic]# #SunUmbrella[Topic]# #PhysicalSunscreen[Topic]# #SunscreenEssentials[Topic]# #Sunscreen[Topic]# #PhotoAndTextPartnerProgram[Topic]# #SunscreenUmbrella[Topic]# #DualUseUmbrellaCampaign[Topic]# #XiaohongshuSummerCoolTips[Topic]# #PhysicalSunscreenRecommendations[Topic]# #Umbrella[Topic]# #SunUmbrella[Topic]# #DualUseUmbrella[Topic]# Sun Umbrella Selection Guide Suggest saving. Sun umbrella selection guide How to choose a sun umbrella? 1. It is recommended that every girl have 2 umbrellas: 1 for rainy days and 1 for sunny days exclusively. 2. Color tests show that the deeper the color of the fabric, the better its UV protection. Therefore, it is recommended to choose umbrellas with darker colors inside and outside, like black or navy blue. 3. Fabric has shrinkage properties, so when purchasing a sun umbrella, it’s better to choose a larger size rather than a smaller one. 4. Opt for foldable umbrellas with three or four folds for more convenient carrying. Finally, before buying, open it under light to see. The darker the shadow, the better it usually is. Sun Umbrella Selection Guide Fabric Material: 1. The main factor to consider for UV-proof umbrellas is the fabric. Studies show that thicker fabric is better at blocking UV rays than thinner fabric. Generally speaking, cotton, silk, and nylon materials have poor UV protection, while polyester is better. 2. Sun umbrellas made of materials like silk or hemp can isolate the heat from sunlight. Thick materials and double-layer sun umbrellas also have good insulation effects. 3. Sun umbrellas made of chemical fibers and polyester fibers are less heat-dissipating, so using such umbrellas under the sun might feel extra hot. Pay attention to this when selecting! 4. Currently, the most common materials for sun umbrellas on the market are mirror-coated, black-coated, and silver-coated. Mirror-coated umbrellas have a shiny umbrella surface. Black-coated umbrellas are more durable. Both have decent effects. Sun Umbrella Selection Guide Umbrella Ribs: The sturdiness of the umbrella ribs is a key quality determining factor for a sun umbrella. During selection, you can open the umbrella surface, hold the handle, and shake it left and right to check whether the frame wobbles or feels solid and reliable. Aluminum ribs: Lightweight and inexpensive, most common, but prone to breaking and with poor wind resistance. Chemical fiber ribs: Lightweight, durable, and resistant to wind, mostly used in high-end brands, but more expensive. Carbon fiber ribs: Lightweight with moderate wind resistance, the most expensive, only seen in premium umbrellas. Iron ribs: Durable and slightly pricey; the one that rusts when it gets wet. Sun Umbrella Selection Guide Precautions: 1. Remember the UV protection index The quality of a sun umbrella mainly depends on the UV protection index, which should reach upf > 40 and uva transmittance < 5%. A higher upf value and a lower uva value mean better sun protection. 2. Wet umbrellas are not suitable for UV protection The fabric loses its UV protection effect when wet due to the optical conduction function of water, increasing UV transmittance. So, make sure the umbrella is dry before using it for UV protection. 3. Avoid using sun umbrellas in strong winds Many small and lightweight sun umbrella frames are made of aluminum alloy. To make them lighter, some parts of the umbrella frame are replaced with plastic instead of metal. Sun umbrellas often deform easily in strong wind conditions!\n```",

Either the responses would be perfunctory, or they'd just laugh it off with emojis or give cold remarks. ※ At the beginning of this month, I filed a complaint because my water and electricity bills were excessively high. Last month's utility bills were the highest since I started renting here, about 2-3 times higher than during the hottest period last year. My actual usage is less compared to before, yet the meter showed higher numbers, prompting me to file a complaint to verify the actual consumption. The first result came back stating my electricity charges were indeed high but they didn't address my concerns. Subsequently, I filed another complaint. ※ As a result of complaining twice, the landlord was called in for discussions twice, and then he approached me. Before filing the complaint, I had already mentioned the issue via WeChat, but his replies were rather dismissive and did not address my questions. Two nights ago, the landlord suddenly came knocking on my door. When I asked who it was, he kept knocking without responding initially. Eventually, he quietly mentioned he was the landlord. Since I was tidying up at that time, I couldn't immediately open the door and asked him to wait. In the meantime, he tried to open the door himself. Although I am a male, I still found it quite frightening since such actions make me uneasy. After I let him in, he inspected the place and told me that if I had issues, I should talk to him directly instead of calling to complain. He even showed me rent and water/electricity bills of other neighbors around. But honestly, I thought, 'Their costs have nothing to do with me.' These are all decided by the landlord, not standardized prices. He claimed my rates were already low compared to others, but the fact remains he hadn't adhered to proper charging standards. Whether my costs are high or low is irrelevant; the main issue is he's charging above the standard rate. Then he suggested if I felt the water fees were still too high, I could postpone this month's payment to next month. But in truth, I only wanted to know my actual water and electricity usage. However, I felt if I kept insisting, it might worsen our relationship, so I decided to compromise (I paid the bill per his statement instead of accumulating two months of water payment). Now, the water utility department mentioned they'd send someone over to check since I hadn't canceled my complaint. I'm afraid the landlord will come find me again, as he can be intimidating. Since I have a soft personality, I ended up withdrawing the complaint, even though I still wish to know the truth deep down 😭😭😭 ※ Ahhhhhhhh #WaterBills[Topic]# #Rentals[Topic]# Complaint Withdrawn Request Number: A few days ago, I sought help here, but not all my concerns were answered by the end. I want to know specifically how much water and electricity I consumed and whether it matches what the landlord charged me.

So how long should you know someone before intimacy? There's actually no standard answer—it depends on your own feelings. For example, if you feel the need to maintain your best state around them at all times, can't even remove your makeup, and are constantly overanalyzing their feelings, spending great effort just to maintain your relationship, then this process would at least take about 8 to 10 weeks for mutual observation, shared experiences, and understanding each other before intimacy feels more suitable. For long-distance relationships, the timeline might extend further, as your interactions may be less direct and often one-on-one, making it hard to judge them based on how they interact with others.

Hypoglycemia; Drinks Mistake 5: Measuring at the wrong time ※ Some individuals with diabetes have irregular schedules and sleep until 11 am, measuring their blood sugar at this time isn't fasting blood sugar. ※ Others may eat hastily and immediately measure their blood sugar, which does not represent postprandial blood sugar. ※ Postprandial blood sugar is mainly used to determine if antidiabetic medications match daily diets. If one maintains a balanced diet and regular exercise but postprandial blood sugar remains high, they should consult a doctor. ※ Recommendations: (1) Individuals should ideally measure fasting blood sugar between 6 to 8 am, as measuring it too late gives inaccurate results; ※ (2) Before measuring fasting blood sugar, do not eat or drink energy-loaded liquids, avoid antidiabetic medications, and refrain from exercising; ※ (3) Postprandial blood sugar generally refers to the sugar level measured 2 hours after the start of a meal; calculate from the first bite and collect the sample on time. ※ Tip: Large blood sugar fluctuations are also not helpful in preventing complications. Some foods, like porridge, juice, sugary drinks, and watermelon, cause rapid spikes in blood sugar shortly after eating. In such cases, measure 30 minutes post-meal. To detect peak blood sugar after consuming generally absorbed foods or ordinary fruits like apples, pears, and bananas, measure 1 hour post-meal. ※ Mistake 6: Not measuring fingertip blood sugar ※ Some individuals with diabetes find testing cumbersome or painful and think periodic testing of glycated hemoglobin suffices. ※ In reality, glycated hemoglobin reflects the average blood sugar over 2-3 months but cannot show fluctuations. Spot blood sugar readings reveal real-time levels, helping identify hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia promptly. ※ Recommendations: (1) Regularly measure fingertip blood sugar and combine it with glycated hemoglobin testing for comprehensive blood sugar control insights; ※ (2) For those using oral hypoglycemic drugs, monitor fasting or 2 hours postprandial blood sugar 2-4 times weekly; ※ (3) For those on insulin therapy: Testing focus varies depending on insulin type. Type 2 diabetics using basal insulin should monitor fasting blood sugar daily; those using premixed insulin should monitor fasting and pre-dinner sugar levels; those using mealtime insulin should monitor post-meal or pre-next-meal sugar levels; ※ (4) For those with nighttime hypoglycemia risks, if blood sugar before bed <6.0 mmol/L, it indicates a high risk for nighttime hypoglycemia. Consume a small snack before sleep to prevent it. Mistake 5: Measuring at the wrong time Some individuals with irregular routines wake up at 11 am, incorrectly measuring fasting blood sugar. Others eat quickly and immediately measure, inaccurately assessing post-meal sugar levels. Postprandial blood sugar is mainly to determine whether antidiabetic medicines align with daily diets. Conducting balanced diets and regular exercises but still having high postprandial blood sugar requires immediate medical consultation. Recommendations: (1)\n```",

We are both in our first relationship, so there's a lot we don’t know, and we are learning slowly. At the start, it felt a bit awkward. Learning from online advice: \"Someone who loves you doesn’t need teaching\" sounds like a motivational quote, but mutual understanding needs to be built initially. 1. I tell him every now and then that I like flowers and want to receive them on special days, and sure enough, I get flowers on such days. Even when walking on the streets, he considers buying flowers for me. 2. I told him I like hugging because it gives me a sense of security, and so he often hugs me. 3. I tell him I like kisses because they make me feel loved, and now he kisses me frequently, even without a reason. 4. I tell him to share household chores equally, so both of us handle them responsibly. 5. I told him I need to cuddle while sleeping. Even if not cuddling, at least holding hands, and he always does that. 6. I told him to sit while peeing to prevent bacteria, which makes me prone to infections. While he found it unusual initially, now he feels more comfortable than I do. 7. I said I like hearing him say \"I love you\" or \"I miss you,\" and now he says these things every day and means them. 8. I told him that two people should be honest and not suppress feelings. Even if it upsets the other person, it's important to express discomfort. 9. We never put pressure on each other and only desire things within a reasonable range, avoiding overly ambitious demands. 10. We never argue over money. We clearly communicate our views on money and spending habits. During special occasions, I share what I’d like so that he doesn’t have to guess about the things I value.\n```",

Reflecting on the changes over this half-year, joining the school hosting team has been one of the major attempts since entering college. Studying in the hosting team feels like standing at the intersection of reasoning and emotion. Every senior at events seems like a finely tuned instrument, becoming a carrier of art. Using one of my favorite songs to express my current mindset: Life is like the sea, full of ups and downs, often seemingly endless; I wish to ride the wind and wander afar because I am neither ordinary nor common. After six months of learning, I will summarize from three aspects. ※ 1. Purpose of Joining the School Hosting Team ※ First, my career orientation is in the humanities and social sciences category. Becoming a journalist like my sister was my initial dream. Even now, being in the xx college, I maintain a reverence and yearning for literature. Becoming a host allows my thinking to remain agile while gaining more humanistic care. Second, I am a native of Gansu, so my Mandarin pronunciation has regional accents. Issues with nasal vowels and unclear distinctions between 'n' and 'i' are severe. Additionally, after long-term orthodontics, my speaking style has significantly changed. Looking at the entire xx, the hosting team is the only club where one can systematically learn this knowledge, appreciating the charm of language while partially correcting imperfect Mandarin pronunciation. Third, I am naturally slow-paced and lazy in daily life, so when a senior recommended the hosting team and mentioned it did not require early morning exercises, it greatly appealed to someone like me who prefers sitting over standing. ※ 2. Activities Participated in the School Hosting Team ※   ※ 3. Reflections on the School Hosting Team ※ First is basic skills. Reflecting on the past, I often missed opportunities to communicate with seniors and peers due to my introverted nature. In the initial stages, daily practice felt exhausting and even perfunctory. However, as my breathing stabilized and I gained more control over my voice, I started understanding and looking forward to how my voice might sound tomorrow (ignoring the still terrible pronunciation issues). Secondly, regarding experience and capability, I have yet to officially appear on stage for any events. During regular training, I frequently feel nervous. Overcoming this requires stronger resilience and a heightened awareness of my surroundings to face it with a more enriched and energetic state of mind. ※ I really like something Spring and Summer previously said: 'I want there to be a beam of light in this world that shines just for me, and I want there to be a stage that lights up just for me.' I hope to pass the third round of interviews during my upcoming hosting team learning and let my voice illuminate the stage and my words become an outlet soon. ※  // ※ // ※ // The growth of a budding literary enthusiast, haha (5) ※ Staying up late writing this club summary gets me more awake as I write. It's been a long time since I last read a book, and I feel like my current speech is repetitious and incoherent. #Original[Topics]# #Literature[Topics]# #Learning[Topics]# #University[Topics]##Club[Topics]##Host Training[Topics]# #School Hosting Team[Topics]# #Growth[Topics]# #College Reading Habit Development Plan[Topics]# Summary of Joining the School Hosting Team in the First Semester of Freshman Year\n```",

        "content": "```\nQuery: The pair of small socks I'm reluctant to give away\nNote: Ha, meeting her really opened my eyes. My mother-in-law, she is the most selfish woman I have ever met, bar none. Even the most selfish women usually show some selflessness after becoming a wife or mother, but with my mother-in-law, I haven't seen a trace of it. As a wife, almost every time my husband calls his dad to ask what he ate, his dad says pickles and steamed buns, saying my mother-in-law didn’t cook and went out with friends. My father-in-law's health is not great; every summer he goes back to the village to plant trees, braving the elements and living rough, but my mother-in-law just talks about how hard it is for him there and how poor the living conditions are, yet she never goes to cook for him or take care of him for a few days. Every day in the city, she just eats, drinks, plays mahjong, gets her beauty treatments, shops, and buys a $400 top or 20 boxes of Swiss collagen peptides. She's 4'11\", weighs 150 pounds, and constantly stacks up on all kinds of supplements. My father-in-law, thin and dark-skinned, works long hours to earn money. Her high spending is based on having no job and no income, while my father-in-law earns barely $600-700 a month, yet she never considers how hard he works to earn it. As a mother, since I got married, I haven't seen my mother-in-law buy her son anything. Every time we meet, she starts crying poor, not even willing to buy a pair of socks for her son. She believes that since he's married, buying him anything would mean she's losing out and I’d gain from it. She never thinks about easing her son's financial burden. Whenever we ask her to come and help take care of the child, she suddenly gets all kinds of illnesses, but when she's not watching the child, she immediately recovers. If I don’t buy groceries, the fridge will be empty because she won’t buy anything. When I was pregnant and my husband frequently traveled for work, she came to 'take care' of me. But every night, she'd go out and come back after 10 PM, pretending to cook for me. What pregnant woman eats dinner at 10 PM? As a woman, she is the epitome of self-care. Approaching 60, she gets her nails done, undergoes aesthetic treatments, visits beauty and massage parlors—she takes care of herself in every way possible, 24/7. She buys whatever she likes, eats whatever she wants, and does whatever pleases her. Anytime something doesn’t go her way, she throws a tantrum. She can criticize anyone, but the moment someone criticizes her, she flips out, no matter the occasion. #MyMotherInLaw[Topic]##MotherInLaw[Topic]##AnnoyingMotherInLaw[Topic]##MotherInLawStories[Topic]# She is the most selfish woman I have ever met, bar none\n```",

Before getting the marriage certificate, I asked my husband's parents if they had any debts, and he clearly told me they didn't. Additionally, before the certificate was issued, his rural family had just built a house, and his parents assured my parents that they didn't owe any money, saying that all their savings were used to build the house. But now, we only have the marriage certificate, and the banquet is planned for after the Chinese New Year. My boyfriend suggests lending the wedding gift money to his parents. I said I didn’t want to lend it, as saving it would generate an annual interest of 4000, but he replied that if we don't lend the money, he would have to repay his parents' external debts himself. I believe that once we get the certificate, we are our own separate family, but he keeps seeing himself as part of his original family, thinking that when I marry him, I marry into his family, not just him. If his salary is used to pay off debts, then I would have to cover his personal expenses. Isn't that just the two of us paying off his parents' debts together? He earns 6000 a month, and I earn 5000. This year we estimate we can only save 60,000, and taking pre-wedding photos, makeup, filming, renting the wedding dress, and so on would cost us 10,000. My parents think weddings are expensive and suggest discussing with my husband to use part of this year's savings for his dad to hold the wedding. I agreed. But calculating everything, we can only save 60,000 this year, with 10,000 for the wedding, and my boyfriend wants me to give his dad 50,000. This means the two of us effectively earn nothing this year. Moreover, I plan to focus on getting pregnant after the New Year since time is not on our side.

        "content": "```\nQuery: Skin effy\nNote: A sense of icy flavor 《Skin》; Reading 《Skin》 can definitely be considered an old book. It was published some time ago, and I had heard about it early on. Back then, the media wasn't as overwhelming as it is now, but the promotion was already quite impressive. Last year, the author released a new book called 《Destiny》, so I went ahead and bought the earlier book as well. How should I put it? Maybe my expectations were too high? Or because it was one of the earlier works? Or maybe it's related to the author's identity? It always feels like this book has a strong sense of icy flavor. ※ 《Skin》 is a collection of short stories, primarily depicting the author and their family in the region of Southern Fujian. The daily lives of a family like this were documented, and as the classic saying goes, the author used sincerity as their ultimate skill to leave a textual mark. Reading through this, it's really hard to express dissatisfaction because you can understand the stubborn lives in that era and environment. You can also understand that sometimes living seems to mean clinging stubbornly, even when it involves a lot of seemingly meaningless efforts where the pain outweighs the gain. However, I just don't find this book good. ※ After finishing this book, the first impression or label that jumped into my head was an icy flavor. Although I haven't fully read any works by Bing, I occasionally come across evaluations or discussions about them. This connection might stem from the similarity in narrative style. Specifically, both record ordinary people and mundane matters around them. Their texts are unusually refined, as if sentences were carefully polished like a fine craft – not haphazardly put together. Sincerity remains the ultimate weapon, but now, amidst the plethora of 'chicken soup' content (in an era when people are moving away from 'chicken soup'), such unpretentious but exquisitely expressed stories actually kill the desire to continue reading. The ultimate weapon lands directly and fatally. The writing is exquisite, the emotion overflowing, but considering the time of its publication, it's easy to see why it was popular. Yet, the current atmosphere of literary writing is evidently different from back then – if not drastically different, at least the general trend diverges. ※ Truly good works are hard to define because there can be many perspectives and many standards. Beauty lies in the eye of the beholder; it might be sugar frosting, or it could be arsenic. I can't arbitrarily label a book and render a final judgment. Since adopting the habit of documenting my own readings, I've been gradually exploring how to view various works more reasonably. Of course, my capabilities are limited, but now I'm willing to do something new: no longer only praising things I like and consider good; no longer hesitating to express my dislike when I disagree with popular opinions. My reading notes are for myself; they just happen to be placed on a public platform, where people with similar interests can also refer to them – but it doesn't have to adhere to a single perspective or conclusion. Not liking something is valid, and expressing it is a form of self-expression. ※ Personally, I find this book average. Crafted, refined writing juxtaposed against raw, original content – it's disjointed. ※ #Reading[Topics]# Skin. A small-town girl – she wouldn’t have committed suicide otherwise. I tell myself. Went into her parents’ room and stole a few hundred bucks – no idea why. Then came secretly to my house, speaking with my mother. My mother could only console: \"Kids are always mischievous.\". The water and the water placed on the viewing platform are always rich and beautiful. Just a pond, within which the various creatures and the stories of this world can make a child happy for the entire afternoon. Meanwhile, city kids can only be happy for just an instant while gazing at deliberately curated scenery... Nowadays, foreign architects often use a term to criticize China: Hollow City. I’m relatively uninterested in Xiamen, in my opinion.\n```",

Ju Jingyi, do you also have growing pains? ※ ※ In August 2013, Ju Jingyi excelled as the top performer among 47,976 girls to become a second-generation member of SNH48. Back then, our class was buzzing every day about this, saying, 'Hey, someone from our class became a celebrity!' Would it still be possible to ask Ju for an autograph now? ※ I usually stayed quiet. As Ju Jingyi’s high school friend, I felt happy for her but also a little reluctant. Ju Jingyi, the distance between us is only going to grow, isn’t it? ※ In November of the same year, I attended her first performance. On stage, she still had an innocent demeanor, bouncing and shining like a star. ※ She saw me in the audience, confidently waved at me, like she was still the girl holding my hand to head to the cafeteria. ※ Afterward, we didn’t meet often. She gained more stages and released more songs with her group. I attended two of her performances incognito, surrounded by fans so loud their cheers nearly deafened me. ※ Knowing so many people adore you, I'm at peace. ※ In November 2014, Ju Jingyi was dubbed 'China's First Idol in 4,000 Years' by Japanese media. To this day, I don’t know who mistranslated 'idol' as 'beauty.' Because of this, you endured a lot, didn’t you? ※ I always thought Ju Jingyi wasn’t the type to cry, someone who bottled everything up. During the wave of online ridicule, I called her. ※ You cried so hard, Ju. Even across such a distance, I could tell your eyes were red, with tear streaks all over your face. ※ In 2016, you starred in your first TV drama. In interviews, you said you didn’t even know where to look back then. But what struck me most were your eyes—so spirited, embodying unrestrained ambition. ※ During the time you faced harsh criticism, people also mocked your height. Those people didn’t know that in your petite frame resided dreams brimming with heroism. ※ At least among those mocking you, few would dare openly declare, 'My goal this year is to be number one.' ※ You said, 'If I’m going to do it, I’ll do it best. If I’m competing, I’ll fight for first place.' ※ And you really did it. Learning you secured the top spot in two consecutive general elections, you resembled a strategic queen. ※ Or rather, you are one. ※ The day your solo career was announced on Weibo, you trended. The girl I’ve loved for so long is going to be seen by even more people. ※ ※ A few days before the New Year’s Eve concert, I visited Ju Jingyi. She had the flu but didn’t take a break. During intermission, she half-lay in a chair, frowning slightly, her eyelashes damp. If she didn’t perform well on stage, she’d secretly cry from self-reproach, wouldn’t she? ※ During Jiangsu TV’s 2024 New Year’s Eve concert, Ju Jingyi tied her hair into pigtails and performed her signature song, 'Love Emergency.' Fans all know that during the first performance of 'Love Emergency,' she also wore pigtails. ※ So how much has time really changed? From 2013 to 2024, through ups and downs, Ju Jingyi’s growing pains have filled every chapter. ※ #JuJingyi[Topic]# #NonTypicalDreamGirl[Topic]# #GrowingPains[Topic]# #JustBrowsing[Topic]#\n```",

What kind of pain? ※ It's not just soft tissue pain. Initially, the screws caused bone swelling, unbearable discomfort, and indescribable agony. Later, I started losing control of my emotions, crying uncontrollably, feeling completely unwell. Even my cheekbone started to swell, and I could clearly feel the puffiness by touching my cheeks. ※ After 15 minutes, the anesthetic wore off—halfway home, the pain became unbearable so I called the doctor and went back for another anesthetic shot to make it through. (When I wanted a third shot, I started having heart discomfort.) That evening, when the anesthetic wore off again, the pain was still intense. I took ibuprofen and used ice packs to get some confused sleep💤. ※ This morning, the bone around the screws doesn’t hurt as much, but I can feel the wound pain. However, the bone (including the cheekbones) still feels swollen, and my teeth are sore and weak, feeling like the anesthetic hasn't fully worn off. I even have a runny nose. I pray I never have to go through this again. ※ Experience: ※ 1. The first two screws hurt more than the latter ones. ※ 2. Prepare ice packs in advance, but don’t press them directly around the oral area as they might press against the screws and wounds. Just place them on the forehead or cheekbone areas for relief. ※ 3. Ibuprofen doesn’t help at all! If the pain is too much, go for an additional anesthetic. Be cautious not to overdose! ※ 4. Severe pain will last for about 3 hours, and the entire process around 6 hours. ※ 5. Avoid going too late in the day as the doctor might have left after work. ※ 6. Eat a full meal beforehand. ※ ※ Update 24hs: ※ I don’t know why this caused rhinitis and pharyngitis.

Although I know it’s possible to reapply after the first or second year depending on grades, this pathway is tough and risky. 3) Reputation disadvantage: My family has always looked down on Western and thinks its title doesn’t stack up compared to UTM (though some say U of T's satellite campuses might be even less favorable than Western?

I recommend the airbnb website, where you can find unique accommodations worldwide, mainly focusing on various guesthouses. Download their app to directly communicate with hosts, and more importantly, make payments via Alipay. Super convenient! My reason for recommending guesthouses is that, firstly, as students we are tight on money; guesthouses are much more cost-effective compared to hotels. Secondly, staying in guesthouses abroad gives you a grounded feeling, listening to the hosts' stories adds a unique touch to your journey🙈 ※ Image 9😻 The guesthouse we booked turned out to be a cozy two-story small Western-style house. Apart from being slightly remote location-wise, everything else was perfect (haha, of course, location is a big issue when traveling, facepalm). Since we booked just one day in advance and many places were already sold out, we had to make do. We stayed for three nights, about 240 per night, shared between two people equals 120 each, quite reasonable considering Korean housing prices, as you know. ※ Our room, called \"bright room,\" was on the second floor, decorated in a fresh style. The first floor had a kitchen for cooking, and the eatables in the refrigerator were up for grabs. The landlady thoughtfully prepared a simple breakfast in the morning😻 The first floor also featured a photo wall of the landlady, very homely. ※ The garden was also beautiful. All in all, the landlady had great taste in life, with attention to detail in every aspect of the room😼. ※ This house had another room called \"cozy room,\" which was also great👀. The landlady was incredibly wealthy and even owned another beautiful property, which we couldn't find online earlier. ※ 🙉 Overall, great room, excellent host, fantastic facilities. The location was slightly closer to Haeundae and Gwanganli, but it took about an hour by bus to other attractions. If you are visiting Busan and want details about this guesthouse, DM me for detailed information. The landlady's hospitality was so touching that I couldn't help but advertise it for free👯👯. ※ 🌟Day 1 in Busan ※ We took the slowest but cheapest train from Seoul in the afternoon. It took over 5 hours to reach Busan, costing 28,600 won per person, roughly 170 RMB. If you're in a hurry, you can take the high-speed train, which takes just over 2 hours and costs double. We arrived at the guesthouse around 10 pm, rested for the night, and started our adventures in the morning🙉. ※ 👀 Our itinerary for the first day was a bit tight but fulfilling. ※ Taejongdae👉🏻Haeundae👉🏻Haeundae Aquarium👉🏻Gwanganli ※ [smirking emoji]Taejongdae ※ Taejongdae is a must-visit. Many buses go there directly and end at the terminal. After getting off, walk up the slope, and you'll see the ticket office for the mini-train, costing around 3,000 won per person. If climbing is exhausting, definitely take the mini-train—it stops at each attraction. Note that the earlier stops are less crowded, and waiting for the next train might leave you without a seat; it's all about luck. ※ Pro tip: Initially, skip the mini-train and take the walking path where you'll see stairs leading down to a sign saying \"boat ride.\" Highly recommend taking the boat ride first. It costs 10,000 won per person, lasts about 30 minutes, and offers views of the lighthouse and dolphins, which is quite enjoyable. ※ After the boat ride, take the mini-train. The first stop is the observatory, worth a visit if you're interested. The second stop is a temple, usually less crowded, which might be a bit boring. The third stop is Taejongsa temple. We went during the hydrangea exhibition, which drew many visitors. ※ The final stop is the lighthouse, but since we had seen it during the boat ride, we returned via the mini-train due to time constraints. Next time, we'd like to hike up and explore for a day[emoji]! ※ [sigh emoji]Haeundae ※ Haeundae is probably familiar to everyone. It's essentially a beach—great for watching the sea, playing with sand, and taking photos. One to two hours should suffice. Take subway line 2, get off at Haeundae Station, and walk to the beachfront from exits 3 or 5. ※ [angry emoji]Aquarium ※ After the beach, visit the aquarium. It's pretty large and located on the right-hand side facing the sea. Tickets are pricey, about 200 RMB. Booking online on Korea travel sites can reduce this to 100 RMB; don't forget to bring your passport. ※ The aquarium features a VR experience of underwater creatures. It lasts about 5 minutes, costs around 3,000 won, though the exact price is hazy. 🙈 ※ [shy emoji]Gwanganli ※ Gwanganli Beach is similar to Haeundae but stands out due to the Gwangan Bridge, which looks stunning at night. After enjoying Haeundae, have dinner and then head to Gwanganli for the night view. Passing this subway stop, you'll hear seagull sounds🙈. ※ After exploring Gwanganli, grab an ice cream and head home to rest😻🌚. ※ 🌟Day 2 in Busan ※ 👉Gamcheon Culture Village ※ For photography lovers, this artsy destination is a must.🙈 It features many literary shops and murals. From the top terrace, you can enjoy panoramic views of colorful rooftops, which are adorably cute. ※ The terrace is ideal for selfies or group photos😼. ※ The alleys are extremely scenic. Every corner holds surprises if you pay attention🍉🍒. ※ The \"Little Prince\" is the most popular spot here—expect a crowd and queues for photos (leaving even a back shot requires determination😂). I advise arriving early to beat the crowd👉🏻. ※ 🙋 (Image 5) Don't miss the cotton candy latte from this shop! Both the aesthetics and taste are superb! 👏🏻 ※ The shopkeeper passes drinks down from the second floor via a basket—unique and perfect for snapshots🙉. ※ [sneaky emoji]Oryukdo ※ Next up is Oryukdo, with a unique name due to tides isolating five or six small islands. Take bus 27 to the terminal station for access. ※ This attraction has gained popularity only recently, especially for its \"skywalk\" (transparent glass walkway). Unlike the Oriental Pearl Tower, it overlooks seawater and cliffs—quite thrilling. If you're unafraid🌚, enjoy it. Note: Wear shoe covers. It's closed on rainy days. Best visited before 6 pm. ※ Although small in size, it left a strong impression on me—dreamy for photography and maximizing leg-length illusions😜. If you're hungry, there's food in the nearby residential area. Don't ask how I know—the feeling of hunger and wandering aimlessly without food is unforgettable... speechless😒. ※ 🌟Day 3 in Busan ※ Nampodong👉🏻Jagalchi Seafood Market ※ Since we had to take the train back to Seoul in the afternoon, we decided to stick to the city center. Nampodong and the seafood market are close, making it a great combination—shopping followed by seafood delights 🦑. While Nampodong compares unfavorably to Myeongdong, its charm lies in traditional vibes. Jagalchi Market offers a bustling but authentic experience—grimy like most markets, yet unmissable for seafood lovers. We once skipped seafood due to time limits but heard positive reviews about grilled eels. Tastes to adventure! 🌟\n```",

Dalian family travel, laid-back summer holiday mode as follows: ※ [Sunshade Tents r][Camping Vehicles r][Fisherman's Hats r][Goggles r] Pre-trip Preparations ※ 1. Sunscreen is essential! 2. Kids should wear rain boots or water pants because the Dalian beaches are rocky and can hurt feet! 3. Prepare stomach medicine (Huoxiang Zhengqi Water is recommended) 4. Check the weather forecast, Dalian fog can be very heavy! ※ [Camping r][Camping r][Camping r] Hotel Recommendations ※ First stop - Jinshitan Luneng Hilton [Star r][Star r][Star r][Star r][Star r]: A must-visit for families with kids! The hotel is castle-like, spacious, bright rooms, good service! Close to Discovery Kingdom, with outdoor kids' play areas. Nearby Happy Coast has camping zones, amusement parks, and night markets, making kid outings very convenient! Taotao Park is free; unsure about holidays. Nearby restaurants we tried included Dayu Teppanyaki (slightly sweet seasoning), Ansan BBQ, and Hard Rock Hotel Western Restaurant, which were all good! ※ On Wednesdays and Saturdays, Jinshitan has a local market (near Jinxin Garden Zone 1) with lots of fresh fruits and vegetables at super cheap prices! ※ Second stop - COSCO InterContinental Hotel [Star r][Star r][Star r]: Has the basic standards of a five-star hotel, spacious rooms but older and dimly lit, service is lacking, and breakfast is average. Parking is underground but tight for large cars. The location is good, close to malls and the station. The second-floor Japanese restaurant is average, not a must-try! ※ Third stop - Dalian Yifang Castle [Star r][Star r][Star r][Star r][Star r]: Clean rooms, great view, and convenient to Xinghai Square! But the hotel is halfway up a hill, so it's best to get a shuttle or drive to the entrance when carrying luggage. The hotel's Chinese restaurant tastes good; afternoon tea is average! The indoor playground for guests charges 88 and is not highly playable, far inferior to the Play Element near Shangri-La Hotel! Better to visit the Xinghai Bay Amusement Park at night - rides cost around 20 for kids and 10 for adults, with sea views! ※ [Road Bikes r][Road Bikes r][Road Bikes r] Attraction Recommendations ※ Jinshitan Geological Park, Bangchui Island, and Fujiazhuang Park are highly recommended on sunny days - the water is very clean! Donggang is great for sunset and fountain viewing, though taxis are hard to find! For photos, navigate to Fisherman's Wharf at the Lingshiwan parking lot; it's great for pictures! We unintentionally passed a scenic road while driving, absolutely stunning. Navigate from Bangchui Island to Amber Bay or Four Seasons Whale Sea Beach Resort Hotel (their restaurant is good), and take Binhai East Road, which features many breathtaking mountain and sea views. Ideal for photos with no crowds, offering many boardwalks and benches to rest. ※ Also, the city's Children’s Park is a hidden gem, offering many free outdoor kids' facilities and landscaping reminiscent of European gardens everywhere. Heading out, Nanshan Road has numerous cafes and Japanese restaurants, evoking an early autumn Shanghai Hengshan Road vibe. ※ [Beer r][Beer r][Beer r] Culinary Recommendations ※ [Chestnut r] Xiaochuan Fishing Village (Renmin Road Branch): The seafood is deliciously stir-fried, and even after eating there for several days, no stomach issues occurred. Dishes like sweet and sour pork, millet pancakes, and marinated sea snails were all amazing! ※ [Strawberry r] Xiding offers takeout; the packaging is exquisite, and their fresh dumplings are uniquely flavored. ※ [Grapes r] Dama Mall 1st Floor - Go there on an empty stomach! Their fish fillets and crispy shrimp at Shuifang, as well as Zhang Huijian’s Smoked Meat Pancakes, are worth the long wait! #DalianTravelGuide[Topic]# #DalianTravel[Topic]# #DalianCuisine[Topic]# Children's Park\n```",

Every time JX3 is mentioned, it always reminds me of those beautiful martial world memories. Since JX3's Lantern Festival was held at my doorstep, I had to visit, and since it collaborated with Cha Bai Dao, I had to have a drink. It's not about playing the game, right? 😂 ※ With the release of Wujie this year, I was looking forward to it a week early. The moment I saw my daughter appear on the phone, it felt so surreal. Once online, with a swish, I reached level 110 and breezed through a few tasks to max out. I couldn't help but reminisce about the hardships of the past, feeling envious of the new players' great benefits. Then I started the 'Tang Dynasty Dress-Up Game' (just kidding), and began non-stop shopping. Wanbao Tower is a great place [cryingr] ※ After fumbling for a while, hesitating as time passed, the nostalgia hit while playing, missing the carefree times. So many friends only showed up on the server's opening day; my original master visited briefly, then disappeared, leaving me in the same lonely feeling as back in the level 95 days. Thus, I decided to take a new master. ※ I looked at the master-apprentice interface for a long time and noticed there are very few Five Venoms masters. Most of my requests were declined, and I worried about being disliked for my age [sighr], after all, most players with time are probably students. Finally, I took the initiative today and messaged a pro because his recruitment message said he takes disciples as fate allows. The pro warmly welcomed and promised to teach me everything. After a simple chat, I successfully became his disciple. Then I thought of checking out what the pro looked like; it was a male PvE Blade Master with 280k gear score and no clothes on. I realized how extraordinary my new master was — he is different. Then the new master asked privately what I wanted him to help with. At that moment, my social anxiety surged, making me scratch my head. Mainly, I was playing Wujie, and my computer couldn't even handle JX3 after uninstalling it for work purposes. I truthfully explained, sensing some disdain from my master towards Wujie. Well, not really disdain, because Wujie indeed offers poor experiences for both PvE and PvP [tearyr]. At that point, I had no idea what I needed help with from him and was deeply confused. Here's the story. It's a bit long, mixed with my experiences: I started playing JX3 in 2015 back when the Changgemen faction was about to launch. A friend recommended Fived Venoms, so I chose it and started on the Weiman server. Playing alone, I struggled and spent three months reaching level 95. There were no duo Qinggong skills back then; only Beggars could ferry people. I ran into a Beggar during a task, and suddenly, I was airborne, thinking only about Beggars carrying healers. Leveling was slow and tedious; I couldn’t utilize Qinggong properly and wore random gear. I thought the game was dull, full of questing and more questing. Who knew level 95 was just the beginning? Then it became a cycle of inconsistent logins and wandering around alone until I quit. In 2017, reminiscing with friends about JX3 led us to join the Qiandao Lake server (now merged into Youyuelun). Back then, I apprenticed to a close friend's close friend and played PvP Five Venoms healer because their team lacked healers. I refused to play Xiuxiu, and arena fights were a nightmare. At the start of each match, Tian Ce mounted up and charged away while I tried to catch up, only to BAM, got clouded by Cangyun while my short-legged healer lurkers were easy prey for opponents (I refuse to admit it’s because I'm bad, not at all) [partyemojr]. That year, I earned the title of Best Support: 215 Undergrade War Rank Level 14 Chaos Devil Extreme Demon Last week’s rank: 64 Last week’s war score: 65775 Ranking rewards: unclaimed!

Reading List; Suspense and Mystery Novels; Detective Novels; Toys wxw's Reading List    Hole Six ※   ※ \"The Day of Survival\" ※ 【China】Earl E ※ Recommendation Index:        ※         🍟         ※ At first, when I got this book, I thought it was just some fantasy stuff, suitable for bedtime leisure reading. But as the plot unfolded, I couldn’t stop reading. I finished it at 2 AM and exclaimed, \"Awesome!\" What seemed chaotic initially had underlying logic. The book is divided into two parts, with the medium-long segment being sci-fi suspense and thriller, and the other segment being detective mystery. ※   ※ First Part: ※  I, Meng Zhiyu, seemed to have a high fever, and the reflection in the mirror looked extremely unfamiliar. Everything around me had changed, and I couldn't remember many things. Could it be intermittent amnesia? ※ Before this, my wife and I were living a peaceful life in Green Lake Town. After a vacation, my illness began to slowly surface. ※ The unfamiliar face reflected in the mirror; the sudden appearance of a fish tank and fish in the house; ※ A childhood friend, long dead in a work-related accident, becoming a neighbor; the unfortunate deaths of good high school teachers and classmates; a once-dead classmate appearing before me. ※ In my despair, I thought it was all hallucinations or that I was terminally ill, but psychological tests revealed no issues. ※ As Mr. Fan resurrected, the inescapable Green Lake Town, the fish disappearing one by one each day — all these bizarre events unfolded, pulling my once-clueless wife into the vortex with me. It seemed we were at a dead end, but our will told us we had to uncover the truth! ※ After immense struggles, as I held the key to the door of truth, Meng Zhiyu faced the most important decision of his life. Should he indulge in the beautiful illusion or risk everything to live in the present and face reality? ※   ※ Second Part: ※ In the school days of 14-15 years old, Zhuang Ling and Shen Yue liked each other but missed the chance to connect. Years later, Zhuang Ling passed away, and Shen Yue was invited to attend an old classmates' reunion. A letter, which used to be a supplementary admission notice, appeared. Inside, instead of admission information, it was a letter from Zhuang Ling to Shen Yue: reminiscing about listening to songs by Meng Tingwei together and playing \"North South East West\" at their seats. Shen Yue, who received no supplementary notice, and Zhuang Ling, who entered a top high school through supplementary admission — who took the letter? Zhuang Ling? Or someone else? ※   ※ By the time I finished the book, the sci-fi suspense at the beginning turned out to be just appetizers! The real core was in the latter part! Personally, I particularly liked the final short story, \"Black Light.\" Though just a few dozen pages, it encapsulated the bitterness and release of life. Humans, after all, must look forward. Who hasn't made mistakes when young? Time may erase memories, but is the delayed truth truly important? ※ \"North South East West\" was a game we often played as kids. Through such a tiny toy, childhood memories resurfaced, adding points to the mystery-solving aspect. The decoded cipher happened to unlock long-buried secrets. Perhaps no one was truly wrong; the only mistakes were immaturity and time. Ultimately, everyone would find relief. ※ #NotebookInspiration[Topic]# #ReadingNotesCheckIn[Topic]# #SuspenseAndMysteryNovels[Topic]# #BookRecommendationAnxiety[Topic]# #NewBookQuickRead[Topic]# @CulturalPotato @KnowledgePotato Enjoy Reading Sci-fi Suspense Detective Mystery Indulge in the Beautiful Illusion or Live in the Present\n```",

It's a short style, giving a very neat and delicate vibe. This short skirt design is particularly attractive and is an A-line style. I've recommended it before. Pair it with white socks or something similar. I intentionally kept this bag. I bought a short skirt, but its highlight lies in the perfect length. However, the belt quality is quite average. But that's not the focus; if you like it, keep it. Tight-fitting clothes also work okay with it — including the leggings inside. The price is just under 1,000 yuan. The black nylon one and the denim one both look great when simply paired. This season might get slightly chilly, and the denim one is heavier than the nylon one. Beautifully aged blue with small distressed edges is the vibe. This small skirt is strongly recommended to everyone. You can try it yourself with tights inside. I absolutely love it. It's better than mainstream options. You'll be surprised once received. This year, I'm especially into these types of camisoles that look better than simple black options. Everyone should have dreams; don't fear while dreaming. Today's random styling and shopping sharing feature starts off with this chain shirt I'm wearing. It's cropped and has a subtle logo here. Vertical stripes help make the entire look polished and refined. Since it's cropped, I've paired it with high-waisted shorts. The shorts' A-line cut is particularly flattering, creating a slimming leg effect. Previously recommended in another outfit-shopping post. It's by a niche designer. Then, just casually pair loafers and even white socks or black socks — very stylish. Keeping the bag part feels innocent because I found the packaging cute. The brand skirt I bought is this year's popular workwear style short skirt. Side cargo pocket solves modesty issues, even including built-in safety shorts that slightly flash their inner white edges, adding artistic flair. Super fashionable. The back shows brand inscriptions. Long story short: when worn, length flatters perfectly. Belts included which align with average lowcost looks though optional by choice.

The first is caused by natural oil return, like in images 2 and 3. This is what we commonly refer to as the 'awkward phase' of playing with bead strings, and there's no need to worry about it. It's simply an uneven return of oil from the wood grains. Continue playing patiently, and the texture will even out. ※ The second category is when normal patina development results in large areas of white or yellow discoloration due to efflorescence. This is primarily caused by excessive sweat or contact with water during playtime. If water exposure happens, make sure to let the beads air dry completely before playing again. You can also apply a bit of oil when they're dry to continue playing. If it's due to excessive sweat, try wearing gloves more often during play.

The round mirror I chose is stylish and elegant ※ Toilet ※ Due to limited space, I opted for a wall-mounted toilet that occupies less space, generates low flushing noise, has no hygiene blind spots, and looks great. ※ Remember to reserve a power socket next to the toilet, as it's convenient for charging and simplifies later upgrades to a smart toilet ※ Shower ※ I bought the thermostatic digital version. The shower has a large water flow, fine water jets, a noticeable pressurizing effect, and is very comfortable to use. The wide storage shelf meets my needs, and the glass panel is easy to clean. Most importantly, it has a high aesthetic appeal and matches my home style. ※ #RenovationTips[Topic]# #SoftFurnishingIdeas[Topic]# #LivingRoomRenovationInspiration[Topic]# #RenovationDiary[Topic]# #Bathroom[Topic]# #BathroomDesign[Topic]# #BathroomRenovation[Topic]# #HomeDecoration[Topic]# #RenovationInspiration[Topic]# Bottom Drain Outlet Thermostat with Temperature Display\n```",

Initially, they all wanted to go to big cities to strive for their careers, but later found that although big cities have more opportunities, the pressure is high, and being far from home is inconvenient 😫 so they decided to return to the county for development. Over the years, many friends around me also chose to go back, and they have developed quite well ※ So, what kind of business is suitable for starting in a small county? Today, based on examples of my friends, I'll share 5 small businesses suitable for women to start in a small county, and they are really popular 👏 ※ . ※ Coffee shop ※ 🍷 Small bar ※ 🍰 Dessert shop ※ 🍞 Bakery ※ 💅 Nail salon ※ (Due to limited text space, more details are in the images. If you're interested, you can swipe right to check~) ※ . ※ To make a store successful and build up its reputation in a small county, the following two steps are essential ※ 👉 Differentiate Yourself ※ Opening a store is not just about having products available. You need to find a way to stand out and be different from others. Think from the customer's perspective. Why would they choose you over someone else? It must be because you have something unique that others don't. This is differentiation, which helps you stand out. ※ 👉 Embrace Online Channels ※ We are in an era of self-media, and it's crucial to integrate online presence. Actively promote your store and products to be visible to more people. If you don't know something, go learn it instead of giving up because you \"can't.\" Follow the trends of the times! Never reject trends. If you're unsure, find someone successful to learn from. No one is born knowing everything; it's all about learning and improving. ※ . ※ 🍃 As an 8-year barista, I sincerely advise sisters intending to enter the above industries to focus on developing their skills and do the following two things! ※ 🔸 First, find a reliable and professional school to hone your skills to perfection, and seize every practical opportunity! ※ 🔸 Second, set a clear career plan for yourself. Having a direction gives you motivation! ※ . ※ Finally, I genuinely hope everyone finds a career that suits them and that they love, working hard for it. Of course, entrepreneurship is not always easy, but with steady steps and down-to-earth efforts, gaining skills and experience along the way, success is just around the corner 💪 Go for it, girls! ※ #OpenAStore[Topic]##SharingTips[Topic]##LearnBaking[Topic]##BakingEntrepreneurship[Topic]##BakingExpert[Topic]##BeautyBusiness[Topic]##OpenABakery[Topic]##CoffeeEntrepreneurship[Topic]##NailBusiness[Topic]##FemaleEntrepreneurs[Topic]##MustSeeForGirls[Topic]##SmallBars[Topic]##Bartender[Topic]##LearnMakeup[Topic]##LearnCoffee[Topic]# 5 niche but highly profitable stores suitable for women entrepreneurs.

I foresee even better development in the future, especially among young people and white-collar workers. Coffee shops can offer various coffees and beverages to attract more customers and generate substantial profits. Entrepreneurship Guide Small Bar Compared to large bars or nightclubs, small bars require much less area and decoration investment. Whether it's young people seeking fashion trends, middle-aged people looking for relaxation, or elderly people enjoying a leisurely time, small bars can meet their needs, being a place suitable for all ages while remaining stylish. Entrepreneurship Guide Dessert Shop Desserts are modern favorites and have become a trendy lifestyle. Opening a dessert shop doesn't require much investment, is simple to operate, occupies a small area, and is very suitable for small-scale operations by first-timers. Depending on your budget, investments can vary, but generally, with a small investment of a few thousand, it's manageable. Equipment costs around 4500 yuan, and if well-utilized, monthly income can range between 8k-10k yuan. Entrepreneurship Guide Bakery. Many might think bakeries should be opened in larger cities for better success. However, contrary to popular belief, a skilled baker in my hometown opened one, excellent at making fondant cakes. In half a year, they opened two stores and managed to overtake half their competitors within a year, achieving true \"dimensional reduction strikes.\" Entrepreneurship Guide Nail Salon. Nowadays, girls often go to nail salons to get beautiful nails done for various occasions. As more people like doing nails, the nail salon market has become highly promising.

(Starting the lesson, a bright smile) Students, let's start the class. Please be seated. Students, before starting, let’s first take a look at the person on this PPT. Can you identify who he is? Great, I hear many of you saying: Tolstoy. That's right. This is a photo of Leo Tolstoy. It seems everyone has done their pre-reading, very impressive! Who can share what you know about Tolstoy? Please speak up (pointing in the direction of a student in my mind, looking over with a radiant smile, pausing for a second...). Great! Besides masterpieces like \"War and Peace\" and \"Anna Karenina,\" let’s delve deeper into who Leo Tolstoy was. Gorky once said, \"Knowing Tolstoy is knowing Russia.\" Who would like to add to that? Very good! This student provided excellent insight into Tolstoy's life and writing style. Clearly, everyone did thorough pre-reading and research about Tolstoy. Lenin once remarked: \"As the voice of millions of Russian peasants during the threshold of the bourgeois revolution in Russia, Tolstoy was a great man.\" Today, we’ll explore one of his short stories, \"The Poor,\" and experience the hardships depicted in his characters. (Board writing: The Poor) Special Post Interview Trial Teaching Chinese Segment Students, in the text \"The Bridge,\" we learned the three elements of a novel. Now, quickly read today's text and think about the following questions, considering the three basic traits: How many characters appear? Identify and sketch out examples of environmental descriptions. What is the storyline thread? Alright, let’s start reading... Wonderful, you’ve all set down your pens, suggesting you’re ready. Discuss quickly with your seatmates your thoughts and insights. (Pause for 3 seconds) Alright, the discussion seems to be wrapping up. Who's ready to address our three questions? How many characters are there? What is the story about? How is the plot depicted? Okay, you may speak... Very detailed, thank you, please sit! This student has done an excellent job identifying main points and presenting the story vividly. Correct! The story mentions 10 characters, centering around Sanna and the fisherman taking in two orphans from their neighbor. (Starting to write \"Sanna—the Fisherman\") What about environmental depictions? Who can outline those? (Pause) Excellent, this group was both fast and accurate! They identified three distinct environments: the ocean; Sanna’s cozy, warm home; and Simon's damp, cold house. The novel skillfully utilizes these settings to drive the narrative forward. Regarding the story’s arc, our previous student split it by paragraphs and accurately articulated the flow. The plot's sequences are labeled as: \"Worrying about the husband—Bringing home the children—Husband’s return.\" It reaches its crescendo and concludes there. (Board writing: \"Worrying—Bringing Home—Husband Back\") Special Post Interview Trial Teaching Chinese Segment Studying the text: Students, Tolstoy poetically portrayed two vividly rich and contrasting personalities in Sanna and the fisherman as central figures. Though impoverished, they hold an inner wealth of compassion. The essence of storytelling lies in this, especially characterizing protagonists through psychological, behavioral, and descriptive illustrations. We shift our lens solely to Sanna momentarily. Please re-read swiftly to analyze: Who is Sanna as represented, and key traits from textual fragments. Highlight revealing sentences symbolizing her disposition thoughtfully with any self-preferred notations. Post-discussion prepared four-per-group format resumes vigor; any team willing summarized aloud progresses....Scene insight deeper textures excellent! Verbatim clusters—phrases five portray grand narrative pivots exemplary empathy longevity tight stories engender timeless visuals classical timbre hold trials exclusively genuine strides! ```",

After comparing, we settled on this one. ※ . ※ The group had about 20 people; it was the first time for my best friend and I to join a tour, and we were worried about encountering tour leaders with bad attitudes as rumored online, but the guide lady was really great, actively telling jokes and keeping the group energetic.

I've seen many girls deceived by boys, believing their lies, giving their genuine affection, only to have it trampled on, crying through sleepless nights one after another, eventually losing faith in love. At worst, deceived in love; at worst, harmed physically and financially. ※ ※ I have a method I've used many times to determine if someone is trustworthy, and it's never failed. This simple method is to observe whether he aligns his actions with his words. Are his actions consistent with how he describes himself to you? This can identify 90% of unreliable men. ※ ※ If he talks about his outstanding accomplishments at work, about his abilities and career ambition, he probably won't constantly text you or instantly reply to your messages. ※ If he says he's very well-planned and meticulous, he likely won't change his life plans for you or cancel pre-arranged activities because of you. ※ If he claims to be socially anxious, struggling to initiate conversations with others and fearing contact with people, your acquaintance was probably long-term and built over time; he won't suddenly stop being socially anxious because of you. ※ ※ On the contrary, this should raise a red flag. ※ ※ A person can't break away from their enduring, long-developed habits; they'll only change the way they describe themselves. But someone who pays even a little attention can detect your preferences through your conversations. They can use this to paint themselves as the person you've been searching for all these years! ※ ※ Unfortunately, he isn't that person; he just pretended to be during your brief encounter. ※ ※ Some girls have described their boyfriends to me, talking about how they met and their early courtship stories. Using this technique, I've generally been able to analyze how these men are. Some boys revealed contradictions, and girls who didn't continue to observe them carefully before committing saw less positive outcomes. ※ ※ Checking whether someone's actions and words are consistent is the fundamental way to determine if someone truly cares for you.~\n```",

However, physical reactions vary from person to person. I have a sensitive and highly allergic constitution, so I had very strong reactions. But my husband had almost no reactions. He was shocked and confused seeing my condition, almost breaking down after three days of staying, while he felt completely fine. After I moved back to my parents' house and away from that environment, my symptoms noticeably improved. This proves that you should never move into a newly renovated house immediately. Ventilate properly and remove harmful substances beforehand – don't underestimate this. To protect your health, don't compromise! If I hadn't experienced it personally, I wouldn't have realized how harmful these substances could be. It's terrifying. Since I am physically sensitive, I was able to detect the harm quickly. But for someone like my husband, who showed no evident reactions, prolonged exposure could already be impacting health significantly without realization until it's too severe. It's chilling to think about! ※ ※ When we initially did the whole house customization, we chose so-called zero-formaldehyde boards. The house indeed had no noticeable odor after installation, so we thought we could move in right away. However, we overlooked the fact that apart from formaldehyde, newly renovated houses may also contain other harmful substances like benzene, ammonia, TVOC, etc. Many harmful substances are naturally colorless and odorless gases, so don't assume that no smell equals safety. Besides cabinets, many pieces of furniture also emit formaldehyde, so it's crucial to pay attention to these things. ※ ※ Below is a summary of the essential steps you must take before moving into a new house ※ [Right r]1 High temperature and high humidity steaming ※ The operation is simple: set the humidifier to the maximum level, then switch the air conditioner to heating mode (28-30°C), and close all doors and windows to steam for 5-6 hours. However, don't do this right after the renovation as walls may peel and crack, and wooden floors may warp. ※ [Right r]2 Ventilation ※ Following the high temperature and humidity steaming, be sure to ventilate! Open all doors and windows to the maximum to allow airflow. If the house structure does not permit good airflow, consider using several large fans. Ventilation is crucial to replace the harmful gases released during step one. ※ [Right r]3 Absorption ※ Buy as many activated carbon bags as possible to cover every corner of the house. Activated carbon excels at absorption and can address areas that are not well-ventilated or where harmful substances cannot disperse entirely. ※ ※ [Thumbs up r]Follow-up ※ After one month of steaming and ventilation, a professional agency was invited to test the air quality, and only TVOC levels were found slightly incompliant~ ※ ※ #Renovation[Topic]# #RenovationTips[Topic]# #RenovationDiary[Topic]# #HomeFurnishing[Topic]# #Formaldehyde[Topic]# #NewHomeRenovation[Topic]# #NewHome[Topic]# \n```",

She earned 15,000 yuan per month, which is not especially high. However, with proper money management, it should have been enough for her to live comfortably and decently in Shanghai. ※   ※ But she squandered her money, renting an apartment for more than 7,000 yuan, buying luxury brand shoes every quarter, and maxing out her credit cards to stay in cruise ship luxury cabins. ※   ※ On the surface, she lived an exquisite and glamorous life, but underneath, it was full of hardship. After quitting her job, she couldn't even afford her rent immediately. ※   ※ Money is not only earned but also saved. ※   ※ However, the reality is that the process of saving money is not always smooth. Apart from unexpected incidents, we also encounter distractions and hear phrases that discourage saving. Avoiding these phrases can help save tens of thousands in a year! ※ 1  Money is made, not saved ※ 2  Money just accompanies you in another form ※ 3  Only kids make choices, adults take it all ※ 4  Girls should treat themselves better ※ 5  Expensive things have their reasons ※ 6  It's really cheap ※ Saving money is a long-term process, and persistence is key. ※   ※ Hi~ Nice to see you again, follow @JiajiaLovesSaving, let's increase our savings [silly smile r] ※ Let's face reality together and create the ideal life! ※   ※ #RationalSpending [Topic]# #LifeAdvice [Topic]#  #Minimalism [Topic]# #SavingPlan [Topic]# #SavingCheckIn [Topic]# #ILoveSaving [Topic]# Avoid listening to 6 phrases, save 50,000-60,000 more. 1. Money is made, not saved When we want to save money, we often hear people around us say: Money is made, not saved. For those who are exceptionally skilled at making money, indeed, money is made. But for us ordinary people, money is not only made but also saved. I know a friend who earns just over 3,000 yuan a month and dares to buy thousandyuan shirts for herself, insisting that money is made, not saved. A week later, when it came time to pay for childcare, she started borrowing money everywhere. If she had only known such consequences earlier, right? 2. Money just accompanies you in another form Cut it out, folks. Don't buy into this nonsense. Sales assistants use this phrase to coax our money into their pockets. They use this phrase to coax our money into their pockets. Skincare products, clothes, jewelry, bags - just have enough; don’t keep buying piles of things. For daily necessities, only buy when needed. Don't use the excuse that hoarding gives a sense of security. Doesn't the security from savings trump a pile of junk? Things can easily... lead to accumulation. 3. Only kids make choices, adults take it all Hey~ Wake up! Take another look, do you really love both items equally? Maybe not, right? Pick the one you truly love and forego the slightly less liked one. This way, you’ll have enough energy to cherish the one you get. 4. Girls should treat themselves better Of course, girls should treat themselves well, but there are many ways to do that, not necessarily by endless shopping. Without financial stress, having enough savings to walk away from an unpleasant job at any time, to say goodbye to the boss; in old age, having a balance in the account for a comfortable retirement; and when far from home, a stable place to stay and a home to return to. Taking care of oneself can mean reading books you love, being with people you like, listening to your favorite music, or having the ability and courage to say no to things you dislike. 5. Expensive things have their reasons This is commonly used by many merchants. Some things indeed follow the rule of \"you get what you pay for,\" but not everything needs to be expensive. There are reasons for their high cost, but consider why they are expensive. For example, when buying a phone for the elderly, a high-tech expensive smartphone might not be the best choice. Good and expensive items depend on the person and purpose! Simple, affordable, but practical things can also be great. We can choose quality, not just high prices; spend wisely. 6. It’s really cheap They use phrases like \"it’s just a few bucks a day on average\" to persuade you to spend. But they are merely using subtle tactics to empty your wallet. Even for the cheapest items, merchants require upfront payments; they don't let you pay a little each day. Moreover, no matter how good-looking the clothes are, you don’t wear them every day. Preferences change over time. Let’s not indulge in boundless consumption desires, only to end up in an endless loop of working to pay off debts.\n```",

John Jeff Salicylic Acid Cleansing Mousse ※ Recommended in my summer routine. The mousse design is perfect for lazy people as it eliminates the foaming step. The 0.5% salicylic acid content is relatively low but also makes it suitable for beginners. Free of random fragrances, with excellent cleansing experience, and very affordable (even less than 50 from resellers). It’s a faultless cleanser that I recommend~ ※   ※ 2. Neutrogena Acne Wash ※ A product that has been a bestseller for decades in the Neutrogena line. Dermatologists in North America almost always recommend using it for facial cleaning. Straightforward and robust American style. The 2% salicylic acid content can feel a bit irritating based on my experience. The tightness is especially noticeable when the skin condition is not great, so this is more suitable for experienced users. Additionally, this is the only one among the recommended products today that contains fragrance, but considering it stays on the face for less than a minute, it doesn’t matter much~ ※   ※ 3. PanOxyl Acne Foaming Wash ※ Already reviewed. Specializes in benzoyl peroxide; I’ve always preferred the 10% concentration. I use it to clean my face, body, and hair – multi-purpose and very satisfying. 😁~ ※   ※ 4. CeraVe Acne Foaming Cream Cleanser ※ For those finding 10% benzoyl peroxide too strong, this is perfect. With 4% concentration + 3 types of ceramides + hyaluronic acid + niacinamide, every ingredient screams, \"I’m made for oily and acne-prone skin.\" The fragrance is also much better than PanOxyl. ※   ※ Additionally, I recommend this method for using cleansers of this type: Wet your face (definitely!), rub the cleanser onto your face, then wait for 1 minute before rinsing it off for better results. ※   ※ #NoteInspiration[Topic]# #OilyAndAcneProneSkin[Topic]# #SkincareForOilyAndAcneProneSkin[Topic]# #AffordableCleansers[Topic]# #FacialCleaners[Topic]# cerave panoxyl dil-free acne wash\n```",

She's never bought me any gifts, only gives the kids red envelopes during birthdays and the New Year. ※ My mother-in-law is a rural woman (no offense to rural folk), just someone who appears plain and honest. ※ But she'll ask me for second-hand bags and expired lipstick. I find it very baffling and told her I could buy new ones for her, especially since expired lipstick shouldn't be used for health reasons. But she insists on not getting new ones and only wants expired ones, so I gave them to her. Sometimes she uses lipstick for live streaming, applying it only for the streams. ※ Additionally, the bags she asks for are ones I'm currently using; I don't have any spare or unused ones. She even asked my husband if I had any unused ones to give her, regardless of their condition. I told her I didn't have any discarded ones, and if she wanted, I could buy her a new one. ※ She still refused and insisted on second-hand ones. ※ So, I gave her a small CK bag my husband gifted me, and she was very happy with it. ※ A few days ago, she asked my husband again if I had any more second-hand bags to give her. I started to feel very annoyed. Over the weekend, I went to her house and directly asked her what kind of bag she wanted and why she specifically wanted my second-hand ones. ※ She smiled and said that the bag I gave her last time was of good quality, and even my discarded ones were of good quality. ※ I told her I could buy her a new one. ※ She said she didn’t want a new one and that a smaller, crossbody bag would suffice. ※ Listening to her, I was really irritated. ※ My husband kept silent the whole time. I found a bag costing just a few dozen yuan and showed it to my husband. His first reaction was, 'Oh? That cheap?' ※ I realized he thought it was too low-quality. ※ So, I showed him a new small CK bag. He said there's no need to buy one for now. ※ I still bought it for a bit over 200 yuan, which isn't expensive, but for her, it might be considered pricey. ※ I feel like I've done more than enough. Later, my husband transferred 300 yuan to me, which I understood as him covering the cost. ※ After all this trouble, why didn't she just ask her son to buy one for her instead of bothering me? I sarcastically told my husband to be filial to his mother well so she wouldn’t come to me for bags anymore. ※ The most frustrating part is, my husband said he didn't see this as an issue and that I was overthinking it. ※ What I dislike the most is, you can be frugal, but don't stretch your hand out to ask for things from others, especially in a way that feels morally manipulative. ※ My husband even said, 'My mom isn't even bothered by your second-hand stuff, so what are you upset about?' ※ I was like ????

Often feel sad for a long time because of a word from your boss or colleague? Anxiously unbearable due to mistakes at work? Feel terrible because things didn't turn out perfectly?

Don’t take coworkers’ opinions to heart, enhance your mental blocking abilities ※ 5. Work is just a part of life, be a happy person after hours ※ #Work[Topic]# #Stop Overburdening[Topic]# #First Steps at the Workplace[Topic]# #Workplace Tips[Topic]# #Workplace Stories[Topic]# @Team Leader 1. Don’t be overly responsible Responsibility does not mean selling yourself. Define your job scope clearly. Don’t blindly take on everything… Overloading will only ruin your health. The workplace will run fine without you, but your family won’t if you are gone. Work is not to overextend yourself; keep it moderate. 2. Don’t let emotions get drained in work Work already consumes our valuable time. Don’t let it drain our emotions further. Treat yourself as an emotionally detached work machine while working. Don’t let the chaos from colleagues, bosses, or clients drain you emotionally. Think bigger and accept that everything happens for a reason. Remember, everyone is just trying to make a living. Life is short, focus more on the truly important people and things… 3. Don’t take leaders’ evaluations too seriously Don’t lose yourself for work. Worrying too much about leadership expectations will only drag you down. Leadership will always want more at less cost, and expectations evolve over time. Don’t exhaust yourself catering to all of them; it’s simply unsustainable. Don’t let your worth rely solely on their criticism. Their words aren’t the ultimate judgment of your value. 4. Don’t let coworkers’ comments affect you; improve your mental filter. Truly capable people know how to filter out irrelevant things. Anything or anyone that drains your energy isn’t worth any of your time. There’s a saying: If I’m not embarrassed, the awkwardness belongs to others. Don’t spent unnecessary effort trying to prove yourself unless essential, save your energy mentally as well. Everyone has their own views and values, don't live in the eyes and words of your peers… 5. Work is a means to an end; life is the goal. The act of working only buys the time within working hours... Whether through mandates or subtleties, always divide work-life properly. Reduce the intrusion of work into your life. After work, prioritize living, and truly enjoy your life outside working hours. Be a valuable cog at work, but a happy person after hours. That’s what gives life its real meaning.\n```",

Sisters in preparation for pregnancy or early pregnancy, save it! Causes of morning sickness: Morning sickness is a phenomenon caused by vomiting reactions due to the influence of hcg and estrogen in the body affecting the smooth muscle in the gastrointestinal tract during pregnancy. It is related to increased hormones in the body. Morning sickness timing: Early morning sickness: 6-7 weeks of pregnancy. Mid-term morning sickness: 8-10 weeks of pregnancy. Late morning sickness: After 11 weeks of pregnancy. The development and changes of morning sickness are basically consistent with changes in blood hcg. Blood hcg starts to rise significantly at 6-7 weeks of pregnancy, peaks at 8-10 weeks, and begins to decrease after 12-14 weeks. Morning sickness shows a similar trend. Methods to relieve morning sickness: 1. Lie down when feeling nauseous. When pregnant women feel like vomiting, lying down can effectively alleviate morning sickness. Use a maternity pillow to protect the back and stomach, ensuring sufficient sleep. 2. Eat small, frequent meals. Avoid letting the stomach get too full or too empty, and avoid spicy and greasy foods that irritate the stomach. You can replace three large meals a day with six smaller ones. Reduce the quantity of main meals by half and include snacks between meals, such as yogurt, nuts, fruits, and crackers. Keep some nutritious, appetite-stimulating snacks nearby to prevent hunger. 3. Adjust food temperature. The smell of hot food can be intense. If pregnant women feel like vomiting when they smell it, try eating food at room temperature instead. 4. Eat plain foods. In early pregnancy, eat more foods rich in carbohydrates, such as soda crackers and bananas. Also, plain rice, natural yogurt, lemon water, watermelon, etc., can reduce morning sickness. 5. Supplement active folic acid. Probody active folic acid contains yeast glucan and vitamin B6, which can help pregnant women enhance immunity, regulate hormone levels, and alleviate pregnancy symptoms. Take once daily, one capsule each time. Maintain a light diet and develop good habits.\n```",

With the medication, I felt less pain lying on my side and started feeling better by the second day, even getting out of bed. While others said getting out of bed was the hardest part, I managed well due to the pain reliever, the abdominal binder (cheap but effective for support without being too tight), and the pain pump. The worst pain of the first day post-surgery came from abdominal pressing, which I endured 7–8 times that day, every 1–2 hours. Initially, it didn’t hurt much because the anesthesia hadn’t worn off, but later, the pain escalated to the point of dreading the nurse’s arrival. My husband even pleaded with the nurse to be gentler, but she insisted it was necessary for gas expulsion. Once I passed gas on the second day, there was no more abdominal pressing. I also bought a handy device to urinate while standing and some honey syrup to aid recovery. Tell your husband not to laugh at you, or you might laugh along and feel the pain—it’s no joke. My husband did, and I scolded him for it. Sisters, remember to sleep on your sides on the first and second days as it helps with gas expulsion and speeds up recovery. I've posted a picture of the purchases I used 🛒.

Natural Disasters Previously, after seeing the Zhengzhou floods, I had this question in mind. Is it possible to avoid living in areas frequently and severely impacted by natural disasters? ※ When I was young, I lived in Shashi, Hubei. Basically, floods occurred every summer. Later, I moved to Huizhou, Guangdong, and in my impression over the past decade or so, apart from two severe typhoons, the impact of other large or small disasters, including the pandemic, on Huizhou didn't feel very severe. (Of course, this is due to the huge efforts of local governments and people behind the scenes. I was young at the time and probably didn’t have a deep understanding.) ※ I’m purely referring to the impact severity of natural disasters. ※ In recent years, I have seen news of cities severely affected by natural disasters. Watching those videos and images really makes me sad. If my family and I experienced such calamities, I truly don’t know what we would do. ※ My question is, for such cities, are natural disasters predictable and patterned, or are they usually sudden and so-called “once in a hundred years”? If they are patterned, is it possible or feasible to choose to live in cities less affected by natural disasters? ※ For example, when typhoons hit Guangdong, we often hear about Zhanjiang, Heyuan, or Huidong being severely affected, but I live in the urban area and rarely feel any long-term impacts. Occasionally, heavy rain might flood roads for half a day, and that’s about it. ※ Up to now, having lived in several cities, I have not encountered serious natural disasters. Does anyone think it might be possible for everyone to avoid such areas? (This is not schadenfreude; people in disaster-stricken areas already have it tough!) ※ The idea behind this question is: can data analysis and historical reviews help reduce the number of people living in areas significantly affected by natural disasters? (Prayers for the disaster to pass quickly and life to return to normal.) ※ #FloodDischargeZones[topic]# #Flood[topic]# #NaturalDisasters[topic]# #EmergencyEvacuation[topic]#\n```",

Adhere to education-oriented principles, reinforce the concept of competence development ※ Being education-oriented focuses on the all-around development of students. All-around development implies that students can actively and voluntarily participate in artistic practice, understand the formal beauty and content beauty of art, and at the same time perceive the significance and practical value of learning art. ※ Reinforcing the concept of competence development means that teachers should integrate core competencies throughout the whole process of art learning. ※   ※ 2. Emphasize the internal connection of knowledge, strengthen the organic integration of teaching content ※ Teachers can strengthen the internal connections of knowledge and organically integrate teaching content through holistic, creative artistic practice activities. The aim is to cultivate students' ability to solve problems comprehensively. ※   ※ 3. Focus on sensory experience, create open learning contexts ※ Through various artistic practice activities, students' sensory experiences can be cultivated while creating open learning scenarios. Specific performance of sensory experiences for students: being close to nature, feeling life, appreciating artistic works, and perceiving images in specific contexts. ※   ※ 4. Make good use of various media, integrate inheritance with innovation ※ Teachers making good use of various media means being able to creatively use traditional tools, materials, and modern media. Besides, they should guide students in applying different media. ※ Inheritance and innovation are reflected in teaching methods that keep pace with the times, utilizing modern media for teaching. ※   ※ 5. Establish an incentive mechanism to stimulate students' artistic potential ※ Always uphold a student-development-oriented educational philosophy. For example, teaching should target all students, and teachers should believe that every student has the potential to learn art. ※ Furthermore, it can stimulate students' interest in learning art through exhibition activities. ※ #ArtEducation[topic]#  #ArtEducationPostgradExam[topic]#  #ArtPostgradExam[topic]#  #HunanNormalUniversityArtSchoolPostgradExam[topic]#  #CapitalNormalUniversityDisciplineArtTeaching[topic]#  #CentralChinaNormalUniversityArtEducationPostgrad[topic]#  #HenanNormalUniversityDisciplineArt[topic]#  #EastChinaNormalUniversityArtPostgradExam[topic]# 1. Adhere to education-oriented principles, reinforce the concept of competence development The process of cultivating core competencies should be integrated throughout the whole art teaching process. Teachers should focus on the all-around development of students, explore the multi-faceted educational value of teaching content, match the growth needs of students, grasp the relationships between explicit and implicit, short-term and long-term, partial and holistic aspects, and design teaching objectives targeting the development of students' aesthetics and cultural literacy. Through art learning, students should cultivate sentiment, enrich their hearts, ignite imagination, and inspire creativity, fully realizing the soul-shaping and wisdom-enhancing functions of art education. Teachers should not only focus on teaching but also guide students to clarify why they learn art, design contexts and tasks aligned with students’ experiences, social realities, and local cultural resources to incrementally lead students to actively and energetically participate in artistic practice, understand the formal beauty and meaning of various arts, perceive the significance and practical value of learning and practicing the arts. 2. Emphasize internal connections of knowledge, strengthen the organic integration of teaching content. Teaching targeting core competencies surpasses fragmented knowledge and skills. It requires teachers to grasp the teaching content holistically, organically integrate the teaching content, promote students’ comprehensive understanding and construction of knowledge, and establish deep connections for the development from knowledge and skill mastery to meaning construction, enhancing overall problem-solving capabilities. Teachers should carry out teaching in the form of tasks, themes, or projects, embedding knowledge and skills within them, using holistic and creative artistic practice activities to promote students' deep understanding of knowledge and skills while improving overall abilities. Through linking their family, community, hometown, etc., students discover issues, creatively apply the knowledge, skills, and thinking modes of art and other disciplines to complete works or solve problems, enhance creativity, and problem-solving abilities. 3. Focus on sensory experience, create open learning contexts. Art teaching should, through various artistic practice activities, stimulate imagination, mobilize emotions, and create images, providing students with rich artistic ways of expression and understanding the world. It respects students' unique sensory experiences and diverse forms of artistic expression. In art teaching, teachers should create open learning contexts that guide students to connect with nature, feel life, and fully participate, evoking positive emotions, aesthetic intuition, and enjoyable experiences of beauty; guide students to appreciate artistic works, experience emotions, and empathize with artistic images; encourage students to perceive images within contexts, burst with creativity, and express the beauty of nature, society, and technology through artistic language and media to experience the joy of creation and personal achievement while improving practical abilities, creative abilities, and aesthetic abilities. 4. Make good use of various media, integrate inheritance with innovation. Art teaching should creatively use traditional tools, materials, and modern media, such as Chinese painting brushes, ink, paper, etc., leveraging the characteristics of various media to showcase diverse forms, images, and artistic conceptions, fully engaging students' senses of hearing, sight, touch, and movement, integrating imagination, thought, and creativity to enhance a deeper experience with art and enrich students' spiritual world. In art teaching, teachers should focus on guiding students to use various tools and materials for performance, creation, and improvisation. For instance: in art activities, the use of brushes, scissors, engraving knives, as well as paper, ink, paint, clay, wood, stone, metal, etc. At the same time, art teaching needs to stay updated. Teachers should guide students in using virtual instruments, thermal transfer printers, 3D printers, laser cutters, and teaching methods leveraging virtual reality and augmented reality for independent learning and to enhance communication with the external world via social media networks and remote communication technology, building learning communities and improving the quality of art teaching. 5. Establish an incentive mechanism to stimulate students' artistic potential. Always uphold a student-development-oriented philosophy, believing in every student's potential to excel in art education. Activating students' artistic potential should target all students, enrich artistic practice activities, and create mechanisms encompassing learning, consistent practice, and frequent exhibitions (or performances), creating more opportunities for display, and stimulating every student's artistic potential, enthusiasm, and artistic literacy while cultivating artistic specialties. Teachers should strive to create an engaging learning atmosphere encouraging active participation, inquiry, and open communication, protecting students' curiosity, and instilling their intrinsic motivation for art learning; respecting students' individual differences, artistic personality, and unique discoveries; providing various options, strengthening individual guidance, and meeting diverse needs for learning art; encouraging students to share and exchange learning experiences and achievements. Schools should organize various forms of student performances and exhibitions, guiding students to gain a sense of accomplishment from artistic creation, enhancing self-confidence in learning art.\n```",

At first, his parents disagreed because, when my boyfriend’s brother got married (in 2016), the dowry was 100,000 CNY, so they said our dowry should also only be 100,000 CNY. ※ My boyfriend works in delivery with an old van and lives with his parents and brother in a three-bedroom apartment. My parents were willing to negotiate the dowry and suggested it could be reduced but insisted it could not be the same as his brother's. My boyfriend even asked me: My family will only offer 100,000 CNY; with this condition, think for yourself whether you want to marry or not. ※ Before the dowry was finalized, we were planning to get married at the end of the year. His parents urged him to open a shop in Kunming, saying they would provide the initial investment. They wanted me to help with the business and mentioned the investment money would be repaid to them in installments from the shop's profits. I work at a stable job in a state-owned enterprise. Although we were in a long-distance relationship, I felt I could only move to Kunming to help after we were married or at least engaged. I expressed this to my boyfriend, but his family still decided to proceed with the shop. During this time, my boyfriend sent me a message saying that if I didn’t go, he couldn’t guarantee he wouldn’t meet someone else over there. My parents’ advice was the same: I should only go after marriage or engagement. So, I gave my boyfriend the answer that I wouldn't go. Later, his family ran off to Kunming and mentioned they had already paid a deposit. During this period, my boyfriend became very dismissive in his messages. A week later, I found out their shop plans had failed, and the losses were left to him alone. Even more ridiculous, his parents blamed me for not going and claimed he couldn't manage alone, so they wouldn’t support the shop anymore. This created a rift between us. He blamed me for not helping, saying that's why the shop didn't work out. My family believed we could only proceed after engagement, but his family immediately turned around and accused us of having too high a dowry. ※ My parents were very frustrated because the dowry hadn’t even been discussed yet, and they already said it was high. In the end, I hoped he would understand me and my parents, but he replied with: If you're afraid of grievances, why even talk about being together? That was the moment my worldview collapsed, and I saw things clearly. His so-called filial piety was limited to his own parents. My parents are concerned because I’m just a girl, and they don’t want me to suffer grievances outside. So naturally, they hope for marriage before any significant changes. They also like you, you know, and you could sense that too. But he responded with: If you're afraid of grievances, why bother being together? Just revolve around them for a lifetime then. That was it; I realized he was just too impulsive, making decisions in the heat of the moment.\n```",

Do the leather products in your home have a serious odor? 1. First, strong leather odors can indeed be harmful, but toxicity and odor are not necessarily proportional. In other words, pungent smells don't necessarily mean high toxicity, and odorless doesn't necessarily mean non-toxic; they're two separate things. 2. Second, strong odors can severely affect the home environment, so they need to be addressed. ※ I recommend using: KongXiao Leather Deodorant ※ Usage:  1. Before use, open the nozzle switch (rotate the small square block in front of the spray head 90 degrees; 'off' means closed). There are three modes. ※  2. Spray onto sources of odor from leather items such as bags, sofas, or seats until dampened. If the pollution is severe and the odor persists, you can repeat the process until the smell disappears. ※  3. Let the sprayed area air dry naturally; no need to rinse. ※ 👉👉 This product is suitable for all leather items with odors. If you want to remove leather odors, choosing this leather deodorant will surely not disappoint 💯 ※ Spraying at the source helps to penetrate and decompose the odor, thus quickly eliminating leather smells. It leaves behind a fresh scent after spraying, is non-irritating, and has no unpleasant smell.

It’s more than enough to finish all the projects in a day, so I didn’t buy express passes. I bought tickets directly on Fliggy for 🎫 600 yuan per person. After arriving at the parking lot that day, I told them, and they arranged the tickets for me~ ※ I went on a workday in mid-February, and morning traffic in Los Angeles was very heavy!! It took me nearly 2 hours to get to Universal Studios. Use Google Maps to locate 📍100 Universal City Plaza, Universal City, CA91608. Once there, follow the signs toward the parking direction. At the entrance, you pay the parking fee. Staff ask if you want to park at the cheaper general parking lot or the more expensive one closer to the amusement park. I chose the cheaper one, which was $32 a day. After getting off, it’s about a 5-6 minute walk to the park entrance. I didn’t feel it was far~ ※ Restaurant🍴: If you want to eat at Toadstool Cafe Mushroom Kingdom Restaurant within Mario Land, remember to book in advance. My friend booked on the same day at 9 a.m. for lunch at 12 p.m.! If you don't make a reservation, you won’t be able to eat there, as shown in picture 5. I ordered creamy mushroom soup (the soup bowl can be taken home), spicy meatball spaghetti (too spicy for me; I didn’t finish it [angry emoji]), a kids' meal burger (good value), and lemon bubble tea (refreshing and cuts greasiness! Highly recommended!). ※ After entering the park, I first played The Simpsons 3D Ride. I thought it was interesting, but water sprayed occasionally. After that, I went downhill and queued for Mario Kart (a real-life racing game, personally found it boring. If the queue exceeds 30 minutes, I don’t recommend waiting. However, this project has a single-rider line, so you'll get through much faster!). ※ After that, I went for lunch. The restaurant was very crowded at noon, and the food was just filling, not particularly tasty [laughing with tears emoji]. After eating, I tried the Transformers 3D roller coaster to digest. I used the single-rider line and immediately got in without waiting, but! The ride broke down as soon as it started, as shown in picture 7. After waiting around 15 minutes, staff came to evacuate us and gave each of us a Priority Pass [laughing with tears emoji]. I searched Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book), and this ride often malfunctions. If you don’t buy an express pass but want to get some fast passes, try your luck with this ride. ※ The Mummy roller coaster also has a single-rider line, although this ride requires you to store your bags at the entrance. After storing them, it took about 10 minutes of queuing to get on. Its unique feature is that the roller coaster runs backward for a segment, but I didn’t find it scary. ※ I skipped Jurassic Park to avoid getting wet. After going back up the hill, I used the earlier fast pass to ride the Harry Potter roller coaster. Strangely, it made me quite dizzy [laughing with tears emoji]. Afterward, I quickly bought a frozen butterbeer to calm down. The flavor was refreshing! Highly recommended! Space is limited, so leave a comment if you have questions. ※ #UniversalStudios[hashtag]# #CaliforniaUniversalStudiosGuide[hashtag]# #CaliforniaUniversalStudios[hashtag]# #CaliforniaUniversalStudiosOneDayTripGuide Mushroom Kingdom Restaurant reservation.

Firstly, you need to clarify your career plans and goals, continuously improving your professional skills and overall qualities. Secondly, actively seek job opportunities that suit you and build good networking relationships. Lastly, maintain a positive attitude and optimistic mindset, facing challenges and difficulties boldly. ※ ※ 🌈 In conclusion, flexible workers represent a new professional trend, pursuing dreams and life in their own unique way. Although they face some challenges, as long as they maintain a positive mindset and continuously advance their abilities, they are bound to shine in the workplace! ※ #FlexibleWorkers[Topic]# #FlexibleWorkerSubsidies[Topic]# #FlexibleEmployment[Topic]# #CareerDevelopmentPlan[Topic]# #WorkplacePlanning[Topic]# ※ What are flexible workers?

Sea of clouds; accommodation; night market; offbeat spots; Jianshui; travel guides; trips; sunrise; terraced fields; homestay; staying up late; road trips; casual photography; high-speed rail. Offbeat Yunnan travel | Painstakingly recommended, no tourist traps after reading. ※ D1: Yibin-Kunming. 8-hour self-drive. Recommended accommodation near Cuihu. Eat wild mushroom hotpot (best to order a set meal!). ※ D2: Kunming-Mengzi. 3-hour car ride, about 2 hours by high-speed rail. During the day, visit Bisezhai (filming location for the movie \"Youth\"). The place is small and quite commercial. At night, visit the largest night market (Dashu Zhai). Mengzi isn't that fun during the daytime. ※ D3: Mengzi-Yuanyang Terraced Fields. Self-driving is recommended for this route. Mountain roads are long and twisting, with significant temperature differences between summit and base. Bring a long-sleeved shirt! From the scenic spot entrance to the eight major terraces, it takes 40 minutes by car. Tickets are unnecessary this season; if the weather is bad, avoid the paid viewing platform for photography. Two free viewing platforms are also good. Accommodation: Stay on the mountain if you want to catch the sea of clouds at sunrise. ※ D4: Yuanyang Market: Terraced fields' closest markets - Shengcun market or Xinjie (the largest). Niujiao Town is more distinctive; you can bring your own meat for barbecue. Lunch with local specialties (Ant Cafe is super delicious). Recommended dishes: fried intestines, cauliflower egg soup, and dry beef! ※ D5: Jianshui. Start at the ancient town and Zhu Family Garden. Stroll around Lin'an Mansion while you're at it. For the evening, stay near Xiaogui Lake with a river view, enjoy the sea breeze, and dine at Jianshui People’s Home. ※ D6: Jianshui. Watch the sunset at Shuanglong Bridge, with plenty of eating and sightseeing! Must-try at the market: stir-fried wild mushrooms and street-side halal BBQ. Avoid the crowded ancient town BBQ stall \"Taste of Jianshui.\" ※ D7: Jianshui. Before leaving, visit Tuanshan Residential Houses—a historical neighborhood with houses over a century old. If self-driving, you can skip the small train. Stops are lengthy, but you can take photos at Tuanshan station without buying a ticket. ※ D8: Pingbian. Don't miss the Saturday bonfire party in Pingbian. Accommodation is scarce, so book early online (recommended Guige Homestay). ※ D9: Pingbian. Visit two free wild waterfalls for photography. If you want to wear Miao ethnic costumes, rent in advance. For photos, self-drive to Nine-level Waterfall or Didi to Dripping Waterfall—it’s a workout! ※ D10: Pingbian. Train market in Baihe Town, 38km from Pingbian. Large temperature differences, extremely hot and sunny. China's most border-town experience. Visit the Hundred-Year Arch Bridge for a stunning view of the century-old Southern Yunnan Railway. ※ D11: Mile. A transit city, Dongfeng Yun Photo Park is great for photo-taking; worth a visit! The ecological gardens at night are lovely for a stroll. Arrive in Kunming at night. Visit Dou Nan flower market past 6:30 p.m.—it gets super crowded! Buy discounted flowers after midnight. ※ D12: Kunming. The Grand View Market is vast, full of delicious food. Also visit Yunnan Mushrooms Wild Market to feel the joy of locals in Yunnan. ※ #Yunnan Travel[Topic]# #Kunming[Topic]# #Mengzi[Topic]# #Yuanyang Terraces[Topic]# #Jianshui[Topic]# #Mile[Topic]# #Pingbian[Topic]# #Yunnan Travel Guide[Topic]# #Yunnan Wild Mushrooms[Topic]# #My Casual Photography[Topic]#.

However, not too many items inside! ※   ※ Lunch: Potato Back Bone Soup (close to SM, take a bus to reach it) ※ Restaurant Name:         ※ Address:            45 ※ Taste: It’s pretty popular, with staff who can speak Chinese. For two people, they'll typically recommend a small portion. Food is served very quickly! We were super tired at the time, and found it quite tasty. The meat near the bones was tender and soft, but not many potatoes in one pot. ※   ※ Fourth Stop: Cube Entertainment ※ You can walk to Cube from the restaurant; it's very close!

Koreans have a different understanding of spiciness! However, the noodles are chewy, and the broth is rich! Order using a self-service kiosk outside the store, but there are limited options. ※   ※ #Seoul Travel [Tag]# #Kpop [Tag]# #Travel Guide [Tag]# #Korea [Tag]# <Memo Completed.

For a newly bought gourd, do not start tinkering with it right away. Let it air dry first. ※ I recommend sun-drying it on a balcony or outdoors ※\n2. When tinkering with the gourd, pay attention to hand cleanliness. Avoid using dirty or sweaty hands as they can irreversibly damage the gourd's surface and ruin its aesthetic. ※ Lastly, let me emphasize once again: I recommend not applying oil or wearing gloves for tinkering with the gourd. ※\n3. Timing for gourd tinkering ※ Tinkering does not need to happen daily. It’s better to tinker for a week and rest for two days to allow the gourd's surface to develop a natural glossy finish. Achieving a well-polished Wenwan gourd with good texture, accurate color, and quality takes time and effort. ※\n4. Force applied during tinkering ※ Pay special attention not to exert excessive force when tinkering because the gourd's surface is quite thin. Excessive force can harm the outer layer, leading to peeling and spots, affecting its beauty and slowing its glazing process. ※ Moderate force, which feels comfortable, is ideal. This force not only allows for effective tinkering but can also relax and exercise hand muscles and nerves, contributing to health benefits. ※\n5. Storage precautions for well-tinkered gourds ※ 1. Avoid proximity to common household substances like detergent and other strong acidic or alkaline corrosive liquids. ※ 2. Protect against moisture! Dampness can cause black spots or mold growth on the gourd. ※ 3. Households with small pets should prevent them from breaking or cracking the well-tinkered gourd due to their mischief, which would render all effort futile! Ending with: rapid touch err creation err care.\n```",

It seems like a long time since I recalled your 'Stories of the Sahara'. Recently, I read A Jian's South America travelogue, and I thought of you. Reading Márquez, I developed a fascination for the peculiar little towns of Latin America, colorful colonial-era houses, winding streets—I saw them in books, and in A Jian's videos. I imagine you must have felt this kind of surprise, too. ※ Dear Sanmao, I thought of you again. ※ Dear Sanmao, yesterday I went to Hankou, walking through decades-old alleys. ※ ※ Dear Sanmao, what do I see before my eyes? I think about the aesthetic of small towns, the tilted compositions, the instability of the frame. The subtle creativity and sorrow of the protagonists—the grayish-brown clothes, the decay of the old town, still unyielding. On closer look, the mossy details, mildew on the window sills, worn steps, rust, cobwebs, sewage, intersecting and organized. ※ Dear Sanmao, I recall writing 'wandering literature' in my high school notebook. Many, many times in my diary I wrote about seeking distant places. The appeal of the faraway was extraordinary to me. But perhaps it was not distance itself, but the diverse possibilities that drew me. I was so deprived; within me surged an uneasy longing, a yearning for freedom. ※ ※ Dear Sanmao, I remember you saying in an interview, 'I slowly shed all that constrained my life, all the unnecessary things. At that time, wherever my heart desired, I could go. My freedom finally came at that moment.' ※ ※ Dear Sanmao, my heart aches in surges, like the tide rising. Sanmao, I have been to the seaside. The waves turned into fine white lace on the shore, then tiny bubbles that disappeared. ※ Sanmao, later I found the sea I had dreamed of, but it felt dull. I had obtained, touched, and tasted the sea. I visited temples by the sea, knelt, and prayed for blessings. In Fujian, Shandong, from the south to the north—from the muddy, angry rivers of small towns to the calm lakes of the river city, to the interwoven canals in Jiangnan, the fertile West Lake, from west to east. Sanmao, I have always been on the road. To me, a uniform life feels like stagnant water, so my desire for new and unfamiliar things always burns in my chest. ※ ※ Dear Sanmao, the hot and humid climate of South America, mosquitoes everywhere—I like colorful Latin writing, peculiar characters, quirky accents. I haven't learned Spanish or Portuguese. Sanmao, does that prairie compare to the beauty of my hometown? ※ ※ Sanmao, when I write, my thoughts wander all over—I think of this place, then think of that. Sanmao, did your thoughts wander as you wrote 'Wandering Journal'? ※ Sanmao, I passed through alleys. Wuhan has so, so many alleys, old and new mixed together. Wuhan is a city of contradictions. That day, I had long-missed Hot Dry Noodles with a bowl of steaming Egg Soup. Sanmao, perhaps you've also been to Wuhan? ※ ※ Sanmao, I also want to be your traveling frog. ※ #Sanmao[Topic]# #SanmaoWanderingJournal[Topic]# #ALetterToSanmao[Topic]##TravelingFrog[Topic]# Dear Sanmao, can I be your traveling frog?

If you disagree, please skip ahead.) ※ 1 There is one influencer whose videos often feature a Chihuahua on her lap while she aggressively smashes a salad chopper (the kind that dices vegetables with a strong slap). Every time she does this, the Chihuahua looks startled with squinted eyes. Dog owners know that dogs have sensitive hearing (which is why putting bells on dogs' collars is generally discouraged). Coupled with the Chihuahua’s small size and timid nature, I really don’t understand why she has to make the dog suffer just to promote her products. Is it for attention? ※ 2 Another influencer I used to follow for a long time and really liked. Every time I saw her videos, I’d get so hungry, hahaha. But then I started finding it less interesting and unfollowed her. Last night, I came across a gossip account mentioning her scandal, so I couldn’t help but look into it. After reading, I was speechless—her carefully crafted image was shattered. What a mess she’s made of her success! I really don’t get it. She’s a pretty big influencer—can’t she even pretend to care about her image? For a fan meeting, what kind of food did she serve? Many people are saying it was leftovers. Whether it was leftovers or not, I can’t say, but the food she served to fans was worlds apart from what she usually shows in her videos. Normally, for family gatherings, it’s a feast of meat and seafood. But when fans visited her house, each person got a generous scoop of fatty meat chunks, eggplant, potatoes, and stewed tofu [embarrassed emoji]. And during the meal, she kept saying, \"You’re so lucky.\" I have to ask, what’s so lucky about it? Hmm... Doesn’t really add up, does it?\n```",

In winter, a gust of wind can weaken a person's resistance, making them prone to respiratory viruses and infections. This year, such conditions could lead to COVID symptoms. ※ This is especially true after the start of Winter until the Winter Solstice; the winds during this period are particularly harmful. ※ The Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon records: Winds from the northwest are called 'breaking winds.' They harm humans by lodging in the small intestine internally and affecting the Hand-Taiyang meridian externally. If the meridian is depleted, it will overflow; if blocked, it will cause obstructions, sometimes leading to sudden death. ※ First, lodging in the small intestine—this means that wind internally can harm our small intestines, causing conditions like duodenal ulcers and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. ※ Second, depleted meridians overflow—'overflow' actually refers to bleeding conditions. ※ Third, blocked meridians cause obstructions—if the meridian is blocked, it results in conditions like acute myocardial infarction, hence the text states, 'depleted meridians overflow, blocked meridians obstruct, leading to sudden death.' ※ Therefore, from this season onward, one must address their weak areas. ※ Otherwise, the organ system most vulnerable will be harmed by the wind, potentially leading to severe illnesses. ※ Those knowledgeable in medical principles are always vigilant about wind's attacks. If an enemy is in plain sight, it's manageable, but an 'unseen wound,' also known as 'bandit wind,' is far more dangerous. ※ For modern individuals, what constitutes 'bandit wind'? ※ Winds from air conditioning vents in offices, airplanes, trains, and cars qualify as 'bandit wind,' harming us unnoticed. ※ Many people have experienced discomfort after long journeys, such as colds, toothaches, headaches, or sore throats, often attributed to 'bandit wind.' ※ How to avoid 'bandit wind'? ※ 1. Place your bed away from the room's door to prevent wind from seeping through cracks directly at you. ※ 2. Avoid sleeping with an open window facing your head unless the weather is very hot. ※ 3. Avoid sitting directly under air conditioning vents in offices. If you can't adjust your position, use a shawl or scarf for protection. ※ 4. On an airplane, close the air vents above or beside you. ※ 5. When driving, drape a shawl or scarf over your knees. ※ Don't underestimate this small act; it can prevent knee arthritis and support heart health, as knees and the heart are connected. Wind-cold harming the knees can gradually weaken heart-yang over time. ※ Source: 'Seasonal Diet for the 24 Solar Terms' by Yunbin Chen\n```",

A person won’t say goodbye until all expectations are drained. I’ve looked back again and again.

Singing and dancing while watching cartoons are the best choices. Note that children under 2 years old should not watch screens. Start after 2 years old. If using graded reading, you can start from aa and adopt a card recognition teaching method. That is, point to the picture and tell the child this is xxx, without requiring repetition or recognition, just pure cognition. If adding a little more, you can expand reading by theme. For example, read books related to colors together; read books related to numbers together. If you want your child’s English enlightenment to be effective, a huge amount of time investment is unavoidable, with at least 1.5~2 hours per day. ※   ※ Kid Two: 0-Basis Enlightenment, 5+ Years Old ※ Using the RAZ method: First use attractive picture books/cartoons to entice the child to get started. After a period of listening accumulation, learning phonics and beginning independent reading is an inevitable path. Phonics will not be introduced much here. Kids learning phonics typically complete it quickly within about two months or a summer vacation, then consolidate it by reading graded books, starting from RAZ aa to train independent reading skills, followed by working on reading comprehension. ※   ※ When overwhelmed by the vast availability of graded reading materials, my suggestion is a main course + dessert combination, balancing parallel booklists! ※   ※ Below is a guide on how to proceed with a graded book: ※ 1. Listen Once ※ Follow the audio to look through the book. If you have extra capacity, prioritize listening. ※ 2. Read Once ※ Read aloud independently. If independent reading is unachievable, transition through follow-along reading. ※ 3. Do Quiz (Post-Reading Comprehension Questions) ※ This step is not necessary at lower levels. RAZ has quizzes starting from level a, but pre-level j, the difficulty of quiz questions is higher than that of the book, and parental guidance is definitely required to explain the unfamiliar words in the questions. If guidance is unavailable, this step can be skipped. Graded reading is like conquering territory; focusing on overall progression in the early stages and shifting attention to reading comprehension questions later. ※ 4. Record New Words, Review Regularly Record new words encountered in books or questions for children. The advantages of recording new words are twofold: first, clarifying the meaning of words guessed from context; second, using a word record book for reinforcement and review during regular practice. ※ 5. One-time Reading of Graded Books, No Revisiting ※ Some moms believe slow progress ensures thoroughness, so they often let their child read a book three times, achieving fluency before moving on. Actually, repetitive reading of graded books is not very meaningful. One of the core essences of graded reading is that vocabulary reappears repetitively at the same level or different levels, escalating difficulty in a spiral manner. So as long as the child’s reading accuracy is above 90% and quiz errors are under 2, the book can usually be completed in one go. However, it is necessary to spend 5 minutes daily persisting in vocabulary review. ※ #EnglishGradedReading[Topic]# #RAZ[Topic]# #English[Topic]# #EnglishEnlightenment[Topic]# #HowToReadRA[Topic]# #GradedReading[Topic]# #FamilyWithPrimarySchoolStudents[Topic]# #LearnEnglishWithCartoons[Topic]# #RAZ[Topic]# RAZ Graded Age Chart Vocabulary Book List Cam Exam.

Often, I see discussions on whether one should buy an all-in-one vinyl turntable, and without a doubt, the answer is absolutely no! The purpose of this article is to simply educate everyone on the shortcomings of all-in-one vinyl turntables. ※   ※ [One] Permanent Damage to Vinyl Records ※ Because the bottom of an all-in-one vinyl turntable contains integrated speakers, playing music generates significant vibrations (compared to standard vinyl turntables). The most direct impact is causing the stylus to excessively vibrate, leading to permanent scratches on the records. ※ [Two] Sound Distortion and Inaccuracy ※ As we all know, the most important feature of a vinyl turntable to ensure accurate music playback is 'anti-vibration'. Vibrations from the unit transfer to the stylus, causing sound distortion and inevitably damaging the records further. ※ [Three] Noise from Vibration in the Unit ※ All-in-one turntables have limited internal space, with components like the turntable, amplifier, and speaker being very close to one another. This can lead to significant internal noise and echo issues. ※   ※ [Angry][Angry][Angry] Here I denounce the brand Saixxx for fooling consumers with its garbage products! ※   ※ #Vinyl [Hashtag]# #VinylMusic [Hashtag]# #VinylRecord [Hashtag]# #VinylListening [Hashtag]# #VinylTurntable [Hashtag]# #Turntable [Hashtag]# #VinylSpinning [Hashtag]# #TurntableRecommendation [Hashtag]# #PortableTurntable [Hashtag]# #MyTurntable [Hashtag]# #DailyVinyl [Hashtag]# #SyitrenSetaqin [Hashtag]# #Setaqin [Hashtag]# #VinylTurntableBeginnersGuide [Hashtag]#\n```",

The Central Campus is divided into Phase One and Phase Two. According to Xuzhou University of Technology's 2024 enrollment brochure, student dormitory accommodation fees are 591200 per academic year. Xuzhou University of Technology Dormitory Edition! Central Campus. The Central Campus The Central Campus is located at 2 Lishui Road, Yunlong District, Xuzhou City, Jiangsu Province. The dormitories on the Central Campus are roughly divided into three types, fully equipped with living facilities. Let’s look at them directly through pictures~. Type One: Buildings 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Six-person rooms with bunk beds and desks, equipped with air conditioning and heating (Xuzhou is the only city in Jiangsu with heating), independent bathrooms, and a small shared balcony between two dormitories. There's a dedicated platform on the second floor for sun-drying bedding, a laundry room on the ground floor, an all-night study room, and a multifunctional service room with blow dryers, refrigerators, microwaves, steamers, etc. Note! Dorms use key cards, which are small and can be hung on a phone to easily avoid losing them. Type Two: Building 7. This is the most unique building on the Central Campus. As the newest dormitory building on the Central Campus, its hardware facilities are more advanced than others. Even more enviable, it has 24-hour hot water, and every floor has washing machines. Because of this, male students staying in Building 7 (as it is a male dormitory building) don’t need to visit the jujube soup bathhouse or go downstairs to use the washing machines. Type Three: Building 11. Apartment-style rooms with three students sharing one small unit. Though there’s no heating, it has air conditioning, which is sufficient. As it is a tall building, there are also two elevators~. Eastern Campus is located southeast of Penghu Court on Lishui Road, Yunlong District, Xuzhou City, Jiangsu Province, approximately 220 meters away. As the newest campus, the Eastern Campus hardware facilities are excellent. Dormitories are six-person rooms with bunk beds and desks, air conditioning, heating, independent bathrooms, and independent balconies. Additionally, there's a dedicated platform for drying bedding (on every third floor). There are washing machines on the second floor and a hot water room on the fourth floor. Both the first and second floors are equipped with bathrooms (with specialized blow dryers).

Drinking too much water. Since childhood, we've been told to drink more water, but it depends on your body constitution. The body's ability to process water is limited, and excessive water intake increases the burden on the spleen and stomach, which are unable to metabolize it, forming dampness. Symptoms of heavy dampness in girls actually include: 2. Washing hair at night. Many people like washing their hair before bed but do not dry it promptly. At night when yang energy is weaker, the retained moisture on the scalp can enter the body and accumulate as dampness. Symptoms of heavy dampness in girls actually include: 3. Loving to eat fruits. Most fruits are cooling and high in sugar, especially durians and mangoes. Eating fruits frequently while having a damp-heat constitution causes sugar and heat to accumulate, aggravating dampness. Symptoms of heavy dampness in girls actually include: 4. Sitting for long durations. Many people now sit for prolonged periods, and upon getting home, they lie down, avoiding lower-body movement. This leads to dampness building up in the abdomen, which cannot be metabolized and expelled, naturally resulting in heavy dampness. Symptoms of heavy dampness in girls actually include: 5. Frequent late nights. Staying up late harms the spleen, and dampness relies on the spleen for metabolism. Frequent late nights weaken the spleen, making it difficult to metabolize dampness, leading to dampness trapping the spleen and stomach, forming a vicious cycle. Symptoms of heavy dampness in girls actually include: 6. Frequently eating takeout. Eating takeout, barbeque, fried, and greasy food often exceeds the spleen and stomach's metabolic capacity, forming phlegm dampness in the body, leading to oily skin and breakouts. The tea that dampness fears the most - Red bean barley poria tea. Ingredients: red beans, barley, red dates, poria, fox nuts, yam, buckwheat, orange peel. How to drink: Put all ingredients into a cup, add 400ml of boiling water, steep for 3~5 minutes. Effects: Red beans nourish the spleen, boost energy, and remove dampness; barley reduces swelling and expels dampness; orange peel promotes digestion, strengthens the spleen, and removes phlegm-dampness; fox nuts enhance the spleen and remove dampness; poria aids in water metabolism, removes dampness, supports the spleen and stomach; yam strengthens the spleen and nourishes the stomach.\n```",

Insufficient protein intake lowers basal metabolism; enough protein boosts metabolism, increases satiety, reduces blood sugar fluctuations, accelerates fat breakdown, and blocks overeating. Tips: Struggle with plateau or stagnant weight? Take note! Rapid Weight Loss Dinner Rule 2: Always eat dinner. Skipping dinner may show short-term weight loss, but mostly due to water loss. Long-term, it disrupts metabolism, causes hair loss, and menstrual irregularities. Correct way: Follow balanced meal guidelines; stop eating when 5-6 minutes full. Tips: Multiple weight-loss failures? Take note! Rapid Dinner Weight Loss Rule 3: Avoid carbs. Carbs are easily absorbed, causing abdominal fat; limit dinner carbs to 50g or less. Tips: Belly fat or thick thighs? Take note! Rapid Dinner Weight Loss Rule 4: Avoid solely boiled vegetables. Boiled veggies lack oil, but fat is essential for the human body. Long-term fat deprivation slows metabolism and hampers bowel movement, making adherence tough. Tips: Abdominal bloating? Water retention-related fat? Take note! Rapid Dinner Weight Loss Rule 5: Avoid salty foods. Heavy oil and salty dinners lead to water retention causing 2-5 pounds of morning weight gain, affecting your mood. Minimize the night burden on your body. Tips: Fight water retention; avoid late-night snacks! Rapid Dinner Weight Loss Rule 6: Avoid snacks. High-fat, high-calorie snacks should be avoided throughout weight loss, especially at night. Correct practice: Replace snacks with nuts or low-sugar fruits before 5 PM. Tips: Postpartum weight? Take note! Rapid Dinner Weight Loss Rule 7: Don't replace dinner with fruits. Many fruits are high in sugar and quickly digested, leaving you hungry. Tips: Waist circumference and belly fat issues? Take note! Rapid Dinner Weight Loss Rule 8: Dine before 7 PM. The stomach takes 6-8 hours to digest food; eating late burdens digestion, affects sleep, and may cause obesity. Tips: Protruding stomach? Trouble losing belly fat? Take note! Rapid Dinner Weight Loss Rule 9: Post-dinner walk or stand. Sitting often accumulates lower body fat. Stand or take a 30-minute walk after meals to avoid abdominal fat buildup. Tips: Aim for a slim standard body weight? Take note! Rapid Dinner Weight Loss Rule 10: Foot soak post-dinner. Soak feet 1-2 hrs before sleep an hour after dinner to aid digestion and metabolism. Tips: Aspire to goddess-like weight? Take note! Rapid Dinner Weight Loss Rule 11: No late-night snacks. Finish dinner before 7 PM; avoid late-night eating. Evening snacks with high salt retain water, causing weight gain. Tips: Seek weight loss partners? Take note! Rapid Dinner Weight Loss Rule 12: Follow dietary proportions. Vegetables: Protein: Carbs = 2:1:1. One portion equals a fist size. Vegetables: Any leafy greens. Protein: All meats with no skin.

For example, this one feels cooler, so it's a cool green. On the other hand, this one feels yellower, which means it's a warm green. So, how to distinguish and match warm greens and cool greens to look amazing? Without making a distinction, the result may not be as good. Distinguish between warm and cool greens, and you're halfway to success. Here are five color-matching formulas you can follow to guarantee great results. First, green plus gray. Gray should go with cool green, as it doesn’t pair well with warm green. As for green, it should match camel or beige, which should go with warm greens. Cool plus cool, warm plus warm.

Overnight torrential rains combined with reservoir discharge made water in the eastern part of Tunxi Urban Area reach half a person's depth, while rural areas experienced landslides and collapsed houses. In She County, numerous neighborhoods had water reaching a person's depth. Fortunately, timely and effective measures such as relocating residents of lower floors and clearing drainage obstructions were implemented. On the morning of the 21st, we found the heavy rain had mostly ceased, and my social media feed was filled with people actively clearing away mud and debris. It turns out my old classmates from the 93rd cohort, whether officials or civilians, were all fully committed to flood control and rescue operations, either directing skillfully or coordinating evacuations. Everyone fought tirelessly through the night, including my husband, who returned home at three in the morning and told me, 'Today we managed to save several power lines from outages.' Hearing this made me feel incredibly proud because doing one's best for the people should always be high-quality and highly efficient.

I arrived at Renji Hospital East Campus at 3:30 PM. The process was signing in at gastroenterology, consulting at gastroenterology, signing in at anesthesiology, consulting at anesthesiology, booking the endoscopy, and collecting medicines. It took 1 hour, and I was done and left around 4:30 PM. (For afternoon appointments, register before 3:30 PM. If it’s after this time, you can't register on the mobile app. I’m not sure if you can register on-site.) ※ ※ !!!Important: During the consultation, confirm with the doctor on the medication—what each medicine is for and when to take it. Alternatively, after collecting the medicines, ask the doctor for clarification because, without guidance, you might be confused about the medication schedule. The provided drug list often just states \"take as needed\" and lacks specific timings (only the laxative instructions had a booklet detailing timing and dosage; other medications had no clear instructions). ※ ※ 👉🏻Step 1: ※ Gastroenterology: First, sign in (machine check-in) at the 4th floor, Zone 4 of Clinic Building No. 9. ※ 👉🏻Step 2: ※ Anesthesiology: You also need to sign in on the same floor at Zone 5. After being called, fill out the evaluation form at the consultation room entrance and hand it to the doctor. After a brief query, the doctor will issue a payment notice (payments can be made at machines on the same floor). ※ 👉🏻Step 3: ※ Appointment: After making the payment, go directly to the gastrointestinal endoscopy window on the 2nd floor to queue for booking (normally, booking requires a numbered ticket, but since it was late afternoon, the machine was off, so I queued directly). The earliest available slots were in mid-August (both morning and afternoon options were available; I opted for an afternoon slot). ※ 👉🏻Step 4: ※ Medication Pick-up: The appointment desk will provide an appointment slip and a drug list (I can’t recall whether the drug list was given at the appointment desk or the medication window). Follow the window instructions on the payment slip to proceed to the 1st-floor medication window. The screens at each window show the line number and instructions. Once collected, you can leave. ※ 👉🏻Step 5: ※ Costs: I anticipated paying around 800 yuan out-of-pocket after insurance deductions, but I was pleasantly surprised to only pay 47.78 yuan (refer to the images above for details). ※ ※ [Kiss Emoji] I will post updates on medication use and surgical details after completing the procedures. #Colonoscopy[Topic]# #RenjiHospitalEastCampus[Topic]# ※ ※ Latest Update [PullingWeedEmoji][PullingWeedEmoji][PullingWeedEmoji]: ※ Just completed full anesthesia and returned home.

The only thing I want to criticize is Indigo Interactive!!! Only Indigo Interactive!! It has nothing to do with the characters! It's just that this anecdote was written terribly! The character development this time is overall terrible! I'm very dissatisfied! I'm just purely dissatisfied! I know everyone loves the characters! But why put such good characters into the mud to struggle! It feels very uncomfortable!!!! I feel that they don't put much effort into the characters!!!! Clearly, there are better ways to show growth! Yet they chose the most disgusting way? I'm not shielding any party; I’m just an ordinary player. I've been playing since the server launch, and I know most of the plot and characters well. Most characters are great. There's no need to mention others; I just purely dislike this particular anecdote! And some behaviors in this anecdote! ※ Someone who, in the main plot, is portrayed as wanting to use mysticism to save humanity, suddenly in the extras reduces humans to mere evil beings to create conflict? I just feel the foundation's work is futile. Is there even a need to save the simple evil creature portrayed this way? Is this some overflowing compassion? ※ ※ I support Seraphina—honestly, hearing Seraphina straightforwardly say things like (junk food, avoiding lead glass is for her good, she was born knowing certain things) in this anecdote made me feel like… this isn't my daughter, is it? It feels so rude, doesn't it? ※ As for Soufflé's character development, I understand that being full of fantasy and romanticism is her characteristic as a young lady. But some small details make me think she's just a naive rich girl. Is the aim to overly portray her as a dumb beauty? The young lady shouldn't be this kind of person, right? Why use some bad experiences to highlight the character? (Indigo, do you hate the rich?) It makes me think you don't cherish the characters at all (such a failure). ※ When Soufflé decided to leave the box by herself, and the background music was 'Gaze Through Eternity,' I was shocked. Was it really that dramatic? (Compared to the young lady's experiences, it indeed was dramatic.) ※ That innocent young lady… ※ Indigo, based on her five-star heart symbol 'Faded Glow,' you could write a story about her recovering from sorrow in the post-torrential-rain world after Mr. Carson's reversal and becoming good friends with everyone in the box. I feel that this would have been far less disgusting. ※ ※ #BackToFuture1999[topics]# #Soufflé[topics]# #Anecdotes[topics]#\n```",

If you don't want to become a general taxpayer, you need to control sales. Splitting the company into two or three is a good strategy ※ Whether to become a general taxpayer depends on the client: If the client requires a 13% VAT invoice, check whether you can get the invoice for deduction before becoming a general taxpayer ※ (4) 300,000 sales: Small-scale businesses are exempt from VAT if quarterly sales do not exceed 300,000. If it exceeds, 1% VAT is required, and invoices are counted against the quota ※ (5) 5,000 yuan salary: 5,000 yuan is the personal income tax threshold. Without considering deductions, if income doesn’t exceed 5,000, no personal income tax is due. If it exceeds 5,000, tax is required on the excess. ※ If your company has most employees earning 5,000, check whether the salaries are genuine; otherwise, avoid such practices (5,000 is a critical threshold easily scrutinized) ※ (6) 144,000 year-end bonus: 144,000*10%-2,100=14,190 (14.4+an extra 1) *20%-14,100=27,390 ※ Difference 13,200 #Finance & Tax Topics# ※ guochowehuang\n```",

An entire shelf of Mickeys. You could also get a Mickey or Minnie headpiece for a more themed look. But lighting here is average, mostly top lighting, so sunglasses can help ※ 5.

Nanjing Scenic Area Opening Hours Nanjing Tourist Attraction Introduction Presidential Palace: Republican architecture, Sun Yat-sen’s office site, closed on Mondays. Hongshan Zoo: The zoo is peaceful, recommend visiting early, or the animals might be sleeping. Confucius Temple, Qinhuai River, Old Gate East: Similar to Shanghai’s Chenghuang Temple Yuyuan and Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street, featuring local snacks and stores. Qinhuai River night views are stunning; you can take a boat ride, priced at 80 during the day and 100 at night. First visit Zhan Garden, Imperial Examination Museum, or Wuyi Lane. Old Gate East has many creative stores, and the shop designs are unique. Xuanwu Lake: Very relaxing, offering different sceneries year-round and great for photography at sunset. Rent a boat and capture views of Zijin Tower. Nanjing Museum: Closed on Mondays, one of the three major museums in China with several exhibit halls. Jiming Temple: Thousand-year-old temple, considered good for seeking romance. Exiting Jiming Temple and crossing the street leads to the ancient city walls where you can overlook Xuanwu Lake and the temple, making it a good spot for ladies. Niushoushan: Buddhist architecture with a European vibe, popular among young ladies for photoshoot. Recommend entering from the west gate, near Foding Tower and underground palace. Xianfeng Bookstore: Various locations, but the Wutaishan branch converted from an underground garage is a must-visit. Zhongshan Scenic Area: If planning to visit mainly at Zhongshan Scenic Area, suggested itinerary sequence: Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, Music Platform, Wutong Avenue, Meiling Palace, Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum, Zhijiao Garden. People stand on every step; bring bread to feed pigeons. Music Platform is great for photos around 2 PM to 3 PM. Nanjing Scenic Area Guide. Qinhuai River Fuzimiao has high humidity during the rainy season due to proximity to the water. Prepare extra dry clothes if staying around there. Students should bring IDs to use for discounts at many attractions. Avoid buying souvenirs at scenic spots; pricier and less worthwhile—many are available in stores. Metro is convenient for travel planning between spots; buses might face traffic delays. Qinhuai River is a must-visit; historically, it was Nanjing's most prosperous area. Stay near metro stations for convenient travel and planning between attractions. Photography Tips: Dresses complement the historic vibe, evoking a Republican-era feel. Yellow walls match well, and corridors make stunning photography spots. Lighting on beige walls elevates aesthetics, with lovely figures on balconies recreating novel scenes. Use mini-programs to book tickets: Many popular scenic spots require advance reservations (via mini-programs). Nanjing Museum (free, advance booking) Zhongshan Mausoleum (online, free) Ming Xiaoling (65, online tickets) Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall (advance, free). Nanjing Travel Pitfalls: Don’t confuse Nanjing Museum with Nanjing Museum of History. Travel Tip 4: Nanjing metro card and bus card are not interchangeable; search and add, metro cards can use the Nanjing Metro Electronic Card, and the bus card is the Jinling Pass Card. Tip 5: No eating on Nanjing metro, but carrying food is allowed; eating will lead to fines. Tip 6: Consider accommodation around Confucius Temple and Xin Jie Kou, offering convenient access and transportation. Tip 7: Nan Station is more recommended than Nanjing Station, located near the city center by Xuanwu Lake\n```",

Remaining time: 2 days and 23 hours. Talented Scholar. Lightly gear up and ride on the road to success. From this moment, steer your life with the wind! The college entrance exam originated from the imperial examination during the Sui Dynasty. At that time, scholars traveling to the capital for exams often underwent long journeys and carried jade as a good luck charm. What was the reason? In ancient times, only the wealthy or noble could wear jade. From idioms like 'abundant gold and jade,' 'golden branches and jade leaves,' and 'luxury and fine food,' we can see that jade symbolizes wealth, status, and prosperity. Therefore, scholars headed for the capital carried jade, wishing for success, wealth, and advancement in life. Ancient scholars traveling for exams lived away from home for months to years. Carrying jade served as a memento of their family, bringing encouragement and emotional support. Today, the imperial examination has evolved into the college entrance exam, still the best opportunity for ordinary people to change their destiny. Students dedicate ten years of hard study to achieve success at this moment, enter their dream universities, and embark on a brighter future. Talented Scholar. Lightly gear up and ride on the road to success. From this moment, steer your life with the wind! 'Lightly gear up and ride on the road to success' implies shedding heavy burdens, mounting a horse, and marching straight toward success and glory. 'Lightly gear up' signifies simplicity and freedom from constraints, 'ride' symbolizes proactive action and pursuit, and 'road to success' represents the pathway to honor and achievement. 'From this moment, steer your life with the wind' means that from now on, one's life will be steered towards progress, meeting challenges, and realizing dreams and goals. This statement encourages letting go of burdens, embracing freedom and achievement, and boldly confronting life's challenges while actively pursuing personal dreams and aspirations. Overall, this statement conveys a positive and uplifting message, encouraging individuals to courageously chase their dreams and ambitions, face difficulties and adversity, and strive for personal growth and success.\n```",

Now let’s make the egg yolk batter part. Drizzle on Chanel of the human world. Stir. After mixing evenly, add the egg yolks—5 separated earlier. Mix them evenly again until the mixture reaches a fine and flowing state. The egg whites should be frozen until the edges have a slight frost. Lemon juice: 3-5g, Sugar: 50g. Whisk with an electric mixer until the egg whites are smooth, glossy, and have a small peak when the mixer head is lifted. First, mix a small portion of the egg whites into the egg yolk batter. After mixing evenly, add the remaining egg whites and use a silicone spatula to gently fold and mix until even. After mixing evenly, smooth it out, smooth it out, smooth it out. Tap out large air bubbles. Preheat the oven, then bake it. Use the Haishi S80 fourth-generation oven, 150°C upper heat, 160°C lower heat, for 35 minutes. The cake is done and should cool for a while. Peeling off parchment paper helps with heat dissipation. Now let's whip the cream for the box cake. Each box cake requires 150g of cream. Sugar proportion: 4g of sugar per 100g of cream. Whip the cream until it reaches a firmer consistency. Cut the cake into sizes appropriate for the box. Decorate with cream, and add fresh mango pieces in the middle. Pair with half a strawberry, and add some blueberries for garnish. You can freely choose the fruits to top this box cake. As long as you can bake cakes and whip cream, you can make this dessert.

So, I unplugged the charger and data cable, reconnected them, and initially it showed successful charging, but after about 30 seconds, the warning appeared again, and the phone went into a disconnected state. I tried again twice, but it was the same scenario! I was completely baffled. By this time, it was already 00:30. I was extremely sleepy but was unwilling to give up. I picked up my phone and browsed for a while (about 10 minutes), then reconnected the power, counting the time in my head. Sure enough!!! Perseverance paid off, and the alert about liquid in the charging port finally disappeared. I could finally sleep 😪(- -)💤. I'm really speechless, is there something wrong with my phone? Have any of you encountered a similar situation? 😵💫 It really scared me. Liquid detected. Please disconnect the cable from the charger and the iPhone, and unplug the charger to let all ports dry. Charging immediately may damage the device. Except in emergencies.\n```",

So we checked out charging stations and realized we could earn 300k+ a year👋👋👋 ※   ※  Who can set up a charging station ※ Initially, we also thought, how can an individual set up a charging station? It must be big companies qualified to do so. But later, we found out this was purely an information gap😭. ※   ※ Charging station policies ※ Since 2014, setting up charging stations has been completely open. As long as you have a venue, you can do it 🚫, no qualifications are required, totally doable by individuals👭. ※   ※ Charging station subsidies ※ Another point is that there are subsidies for charging stations in many places, and many people are unaware🌟. ※   ※ For instance, a fast-charging station🔋 can receive a subsidy of 200-500 yuan/kw. For a 120kw charging station, the subsidy could be 24k-60k, which basically means the equipment is almost free💪. ※   ※  Charging station profits ※ Finally, let's talk about profits. Charging stations earn through service fees. While electricity costs are significant, making it hard to profit here, our local service fee is about 0.4 yuan/kwh. For example, a 120kw charging station operating for 5 hours a day would consume 600 kwh of electricity per day. ※   ※ 📣Daily: 0.4*600=240 yuan ※ 📣Yearly: 240*365=87.6k💰 ※   ※ This is just for one unit. A typical charging station might have 3-10 devices, depending on the venue size. We set up 3 charging stations and made over 300k💰 in a year. ※   ※ 👉 What's the key? It's that new energy vehicles🚗 are still rapidly growing. Moreover, I predict charging prices will rise📈, EV ownership will increase, and profits will grow even higher.

Packages and Spending (p1-p3) ※ Pros: None. Oh, well, spending 14,000 diamonds + 288CNY to get all the clothes (excluding balls) barely counts (?) ※ After all, Flash Nikki is a minimally pay-to-win game with decent gaming experience [smirk face]. ※ Cons: Package value is too low. Each of the 3 packages forcefully includes a name change card, which is really redundant [embarrassed face]. ※ Originally planned to spend on the 388CNY level but held back. A single ID for as long as you play doesn’t need so many name change cards (even if a name change card originally costs 68CNY, it doesn't change its low value). ※ By the way, about the decorations (home furniture), Flash Nikki's home decoration is quite troublesome. Bought a lot of items with packages, but all are collecting dust in the warehouse [covering face]. ※ The home system is definitely more suitable for PC. Probably can only hope for Nikki 5 now [laugh-cry face]. ※ 2. Clothes (p4-p6) ※ Pros: The flash set meets expectations, and the effects are good. Between the two sets, I prefer the Scroll Set; the quicksand effect is quite unique. Plum and Crane, the cumulative recharge set, uses elements I personally like, and the effects are reasonable. ※ Cons: The two flash dresses, although the styles are certainly different, always give me a similar impression, both are chest-hugging, waist-cinching, then slightly straight. ※ However, the style is not the focus; the focus is the metallic texture issue, which looks somewhat cheap [embarrassed face]. ※ The Extraordinary Set is cute, but the gradient socks are hard to evaluate, and the hairstyle is average. ※ Other minor flaws are worth mentioning briefly: color choice for the painting set, the automatic filter of the Heart Bloom Bracelet, the too-fast special effect of the Water Dragon Set. ※ Additional: This year's benefits increased a lot through redemption codes, or else I wouldn't have been able to get both flash sets for 288CNY. Overall, the New Year Pavilion experience is okay. No comment on the plot side. I'm generally lenient toward games that don't use the plot as their main selling point as long as there are no major issues or it's not particularly bad [smirk face]. ※ Finally, here's a photo of last week's styling competition (p7).

Hand-kneading glove film; Baking; Food; Bread. Since I don't own a mixer but wanted to eat toast and bread, I started trying to hand-knead the dough. I tried non-stop for many days but failed repeatedly. Today, I finally succeeded following my own habits. ※ Dough part ※ High-gluten flour 250g ※ Water 100g and 50g milk, totaling 150g ※ Egg white 1 ※ Sugar 30g ※ Salt 3g ※ Yeast 3g ※ Butter 20g ※ 1. First, mix water, milk, egg white, sugar, and salt together until well combined. ※ 2. Then, pour this mixture little by little into the high-gluten flour to form a shaggy dough, and then knead it into a ball. The dough I kneaded is a bit firm. Cover it with a thin layer of cooking oil, seal with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least half an hour. I refrigerated it for an hour and a half. Hydration makes it easier to form the film. ※ 3. Don’t worry if the dough feels firm initially; it helps in kneading to form the glove film. Personally, I don't like dough that starts out sticky as it's hard to knead. More water can be added later. ※ 4. Mix 10g of milk and yeast, stir evenly, and set aside. ※ 5. Take out the hydrated dough, knead it briefly on the counter, then add the yeast liquid. Continue kneading the dough. Since the dough is firm, after kneading briefly, the yeast water will fully incorporate and it won't stick much to your hands. Knead until smooth. ※ 6. At this point, take the yeast-added dough and slap it onto the counter for 5 minutes. Fold the dough that's in your hand onto the counter-slapped dough, then pick it up and slap it again, repeating this motion. You can speed up for better results. I find slapping dough easier than kneading, and I enjoy the de-stressing process of slapping dough. Additionally, the glove film forms quickly—after slapping for 5 minutes, you can already stretch out a thick film. Let it rest for 15 minutes. ※ 7. After resting, add softened butter at room temperature into the dough. Knead it in using any method until the butter is fully absorbed into the dough. This doesn’t take long—just about 2 minutes for me. At this point, the dough is very soft and fragrant. Continue slapping for another 5 minutes. The more you slap, the more bouncy the dough becomes, less sticky to hands and counter, and smoother. ※ 8. After slapping for 5 minutes, cover the smooth dough with plastic wrap and let it sit for 5 minutes. Cut out a piece and slowly stretch it—you’ll see the glove film. The entire process didn’t feel tedious, and forming the film was relatively quick. ※ Excluding the resting time, it actually takes less than 20 minutes to knead the dough into the glove film. ※ This is my entire process of hand-kneading dough into the glove film. Hope this helps friends who love making bread but can’t afford a mixer. ※ #DoItYourself[Topic]# #GloveFilm[Topic]# #ToastBread[Topic]# #HandmadeBread[Topic]# #BakingRecipe[Topic]# #HandKneadedGloveFilm[Topic]# #Bread[Topic]# #FoodMaking[Topic]# Found the secret to kneading glove film Milk, water, sugar, salt, and egg white mixture.

This combines glossy tiles with matte tiles for the kitchen and bathroom; Bathroom; Kitchen; Kitchen Decor; Floor Tiles; Matte Tiles; Cleaning; Ceramic Tiles; Renovation. A 6㎡ small kitchen and a 4.5㎡ wet-dry separated bathroom ※ For a family that cooks daily, kitchen hygiene and cleanliness are a major consideration. Since the whole house uses matte tiles, the choice of wall tiles—whether to use matte or glossy—became my dilemma at the initial stage of renovation. Eventually, I chose light-colored tiles with fine, nearly invisible patterns and a glossy finish. Let me explain my reasons below: ※ ※ [Point 1] The kitchen is the grease hub of every family. Since wall tile areas are much larger than the floor, wall tiles must be easy to clean. Personally, I feel glossy tiles are much easier to wipe clean compared to matte ones. While floor tiles benefit from cleaning robots and mopping machines, most families still rely on manual cleaning for wall tiles. Ease of cleaning became one of the important factors in choosing glossy wall tiles. ※ [Point 2] To match the matte tiles and maintain an overall coordinated space, I avoided choosing conspicuously patterned fish-belly white tiles or matte tiles on the walls. Instead, I went with glossy tiles of the same color tone as the floor tiles with very subtle patterns that are almost invisible to the naked eye. I also customized grout to match the tiles, which I feel resulted in a pretty good overall effect. ※ ※ [Point 3] As for the bathroom, after every shower, a squeegee swipe on the walls is enough. No need to dry them; they air-dry without leaving watermarks, which makes them very easy to maintain. ※ ※ After moving in, it turned out just as I expected—maintenance is really easy. I hope my little renovation experience can help those of you struggling to decide~ ※ #RenovationDiary[tag]# #FrenchRetro[tag]# #Kitchen[tag]# #KitchenRenovation[tag]# #KitchenDesign[tag]# #MatteTiles[tag]# #GlossyTiles[tag]# #Grouting[tag]# #GroutSealant[tag]# #RenovationOnXiaohongshu[tag]# #VintageStyleRenovation[tag]# #Renovation[tag]# #CustomDesign[tag]# #Bathroom[tag]# #RetroBathroom[tag]#\n```",

Thousand-layer steamed buns; Summer; Handmade; Steamed buns. Before writing this note, I conducted numerous tests: ※ 1. Different water content ※ 2. Various fermentation times and durations ※ 3. Shaping techniques ※ 4. Tried both single and double fermentation for comparison ※ - ※ While the appearance turned out well, the flavor still didn't quite meet my ideal. Through continuous experiments, I thought: how can I make it both beautiful and delicious? ※ Being fond of old starter steamed buns, I thought of using old starter. With the addition of old starter, the texture and flavor of the finished product improved and matched my expectations~ ※ If you also enjoy layered, soft, and chewy steamed buns, pay close attention to the detailed steps and key points in this note, and you too can succeed on the first try ※      ※ 👉Prepare the old starter in advance: ※ Mix 70g of warm water (around 35°C) with 1g of yeast, 100g of regular flour, 1g of salt, and 2g of sugar. Stir into a dough with a spatula, seal and ferment until doubled in size, then refrigerate overnight for later use ※ 👉Kneading: ※ Mix 500g of regular flour, 220g of cold water (use ice water in summer), all the prepared old starter, 20-50g of white sugar, and 3g of yeast into a smooth dough, then let it rest for 10 minutes ※ 👉Techniques for layered texture (prepare 120g of dry flour in advance): ※ Roll out the rested dough into a rectangle, sprinkle dry flour on the dough sheet, fold into thirds, roll out again, and repeatedly sprinkle flour and fold 7-8 times until all the dry flour is used up. For the final roll-out, brush with oil, sprinkle dry flour, and then roll from one end tightly ※   You can directly cut it into sections for traditional steamed buns, place them in a steamer for proofing before steaming ※   You can also roll the dough into a ball, place it in the steamer for proofing before steaming ※ 👉Fermentation: ※ Let it proof to about double its size, then steam over medium heat from cold water. Start counting 10-12 minutes after steam emerges, let it rest for 3 minutes, and then remove from the steamer (steaming time depends on the size of the steamed buns) ※      ※ ! Key to distinct layers: ※   The dough for this steamed bun is drier than regular buns, which is a key element for distinct layers   ※   Brushing oil and sprinkling dry flour on the last roll-out before rolling up is the second key ※   The final proofing shouldn't be overdone; it should be less than usual for making steamed buns, which is the third key ※   Repeated rolling and folding makes the process lengthy. To prevent premature fermentation, minimize the amount of yeast used, as premature fermentation would be difficult to control ※  These thousand-layer hand-torn steamed buns were requested by fans during the summer. I've delayed for months, testing and perfecting a satisfactory recipe and techniques before sharing. For things I am passionate about, I personally research and grasp the operational techniques and tips to share them, so you can avoid detours and succeed on your first attempt ※   ※ Thank you for watching, try it out this weekend~ ※   ※ #ThousandLayerSteamedBuns[Topic]# #OldStarter[Topic]# #SteamedBuns[Topic]# #HandmadeSteamedBuns[Topic]# Prepare old starter in advance.

Study; exercise #Strive to become a better self[topic]# ※ Do you find it hard to concentrate, picking up your phone to watch videos after studying for just a few minutes? ※ Are your eyes and brain disconnected while studying—your eyes on the book, but your mind wandering? ※ Do you get distracted easily while studying, even looking up when someone walks by? ※ Ultimately, it's because your energy field is too weak! ※ - ※ 🌟 Many of us struggle with concentration and can't quit phone usage while studying! ※ The underlying cause is that your physical and mental energy is too weak. Your body gets fatigued, your spirit feels depleted, and you seek relaxation by scrolling on your phone. ※ Studying requires your full attention and consumes a lot of energy. So when your physical and mental energy is lacking, resistance arises, manifesting as: ※ Irritation—you want to study but can't get in the zone. Not studying makes you feel guilty, leading to anxiety. ※ To escape the anxiety, you turn to your phone to pass the time and numb yourself. Wasting time like this creates a cycle of deeper anxiety and inner turmoil. ※   ※ Without sufficient physical energy, you can't sustain studying. ※ Without inner energy, it's easy to crumble under trivial matters and negative emotions. ※ Lacking both physical and mental energy, you naturally lose interest in studying. Even if you force yourself to study, you'll likely give up within months, potentially harming both body and mind. ※   ※ Even with strong willpower, ignoring your fatigued body and sensitive, fearful, self-critical mind won't work. If you don't take care of yourself, how will they support you in learning? ※ - ※ 💡 How can you boost your physical and mental energy? ※ The method is simple—address both body and mind. ※ 1 Body ※ Exercise. Exercise daily; it boosts your energy. Jogging for 30 minutes daily can help cultivate resilience and maintain consistency through challenges. ※ Ensure enough sleep. Only with adequate sleep can you have the energy to study. Avoid sacrificing rest time for longer study hours—it will lower your efficiency. ※ 2 Mind ※ Focus less on others and more on yourself. Don't waste energy on unrelated people. Observe yourself and understand your desires. Learn to be self-sufficient, accept, and even like the imperfect version of yourself. ※ Gain energy through self-awareness. Frequently engage in internal dialogue with yourself. Find a sense of achievement in the small things from daily life and work. ※ Allow yourself to give up or fail. Live earnestly. Spend weekends dining with good friends or watching movies. ※ When facing difficulties, look upward. Temporary setbacks are no big deal. Face challenges proactively, adjust your direction, and keep going. ※ Compliment yourself. Every time you complete a study plan or overcome a challenging problem, praise yourself with \"I'm awesome\" or \"Great job!\" ※ Meditate. Meditation genuinely brings inner calm. ※ Recharge your body and mind. With strong physical and mental energy, studying becomes an easy task! ※ #Self-discipline[topic]# #girls talk[topic]# #Study[topic]# #College student[topic]# Came across two cats fighting.

My suggestion is for sisters visiting in June, July, and August. My friend and I went to Nanjing and came back feeling emo. Nanjing isn’t expensive, but without a plan, you could hit a few pitfalls. We spent thousands in three days, which is heartbreaking in retrospect! Honestly, if you play wisely with a detailed guide, 600 yuan per person should suffice! Consolidating these notes today for reference for those about to visit Nanjing!!! Hope sisters avoid pitfalls and have a happy trip~. Memo Nanjing Scenic Guide Memo Nanjing Avoidance Tips 1. You can buy student tickets for Niushou Mountain, 49 yuan, free for those over 70. 2. For those visiting Niushou Mountain, enter from the west gate, which is halfway up the mountain (east gate is at the foot), closer to must-see locations like Foding Tower and Underground Palace!! 3. If you want photos without people at Niushou Mountain, be there before 8:30am. As soon as the gates open, take a 10 yuan shuttle to Foding Tower’s base for easy photography haha! 4. Visit Qinhuai River Confucius Temple at night. It’s an ordinary shopping street by day, but the lights at night feel like traveling to old Jinling. 5. Rent an electric car when going to Zhongshan Mausoleum. The scenic area is too big! Wear comfortable sports shoes. 6. Book a week in advance for the Memorial Hall of Victims by Japanese Invaders. Every Chinese should, it has special meaning. Dress properly. Don’t overdo flashy clothing! 7. No loud talking, phone music playing, or food on Nanjing subways—I saw someone fined 20 yuan! They do enforce these rules! 8. Use Nanjing's metro system. Upon arriving, apply for a transportation code. Very convenient. 9. Visit the Music Platform between 2:00 and 3:00 pm; after 5:00 pm, pigeons stop being active. Bring bread for great pigeon pictures. 10. Although sightseeing cars at Music Platform are said to take 30 minutes to arrive, they often show up within 10 minutes! Best experience: sit in the last row of the windowless car. 11. Highly recommend Hongshan Zoo! Enter at 8:30 am and head to the panda exhibit. If not, save an afternoon. 12. Buy paper tickets (10RMB) directly for Jiming Temple for quick entry. E-tickets require queueing! 13. Outside Jiming Temple is Suweizhai, a famous café with “Shanxi's cat paw stamp.” Skip temple tickets if only for photos. Navigate directly. 14. Cross the street exiting Jiming Temple to reach the Ming City Walls, where Xuanwu Lake and Jiming Temple view is ideal for girls taking photos. 15. Recommended Zhongshan route: Linggu Temple > Music Platform > Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum > Ming Xiaoling > Meiling Palace. 16. Choose Nanjing or Nanjing South railroad for arrivals (High-speed+rail connects). Confucius Temple Centre under 30min metro ride. Prefer “Nanjing Station,” Xuanwu Lake nearby walking-friendly leisure hub. 17. Skip online foodie fame for snacks local winding alleys elderly population communal. Avoid pitfalls!

First time shooting the Milky Way, no disappointments, some gains. ※ No rambling ※ 1 Location: Anding Mountain, altitude 660m, 1h drive from Xiaoshan. There is a parking lot and camping site nearby (high altitude, low light pollution, convenient roads). Navigate directly; the whole route is on main roads, easy to drive. The road narrows slightly near the destination but is still manageable. ※ 2 Shooting Equipment: A high-ISO camera, wide-aperture, wide-angle lens. I'm using a Sony a7RII and 17-40mm f4. I've always wanted to switch to 16-35mm f2.8 but haven't sold the current one yet. The f4 still works for Milky Way shots; ISO 6400, 15s, f4 without streaking. However, if your camera struggles with high ISO, opt for a wide-aperture lens or use an equatorial mount for long exposure. ※ 3 Auxiliary Equipment: Tripod, panoramic stitching head, anti-fog strap, wireless remote. A sturdy tripod is a must to reduce shaking; you can add a stone bag for extra stability. A panoramic stitching head is for Milky Way arches. Example in image P7 (for reference, search for Panstark panoramic stitching head on orange apps). It's crucial to level the setup before shooting; otherwise, the stitching will misalign. A 17mm wide-angle cannot capture the Milky Way arch in one shot. Try ultrawide if you can. Anti-fog strap to keep the lens warm and prevent condensation. Wireless remote (I use Godox) allows for interval shooting stacks and peace of mind, so you can stay warm in the car. ※ 4 Pre-Shooting Software: Use SkySafari to check stargazing conditions, probabilities, and light pollution in the area. Use Windy to check cloud patterns, directions, and low-to-high cloud heights to avoid mishaps. PhotoPills for altitude, positioning, and actual framing. For site checking, Star Walk 2 is helpful for Milky Way positioning. ※ 5 Post-Shooting Software: PTGui for panoramic stitching, Sequator for stacking, Lightroom for color grading (my grading might be off; you can search for tutorials yourself), Photoshop for sky and ground separation processing, Nik plugins for enhancement. ※ 6 Equipment: Waterproof jackets and pants, flashlight, power bank, windproof gear, camping gear (optional), weights (or me 😎, kidding). ※ 7 Timing: Editing in progress! Milky Way shooting times vary by season. Currently, the best time is around 1 AM to 3:30 AM when the elevation angle is most suitable. Check PhotoPills Pro before heading out for framing! ※ I debated locations like Taizi Peak, Qianniugang, or other spots before setting out. But I’m in Xiaoshan, and a 2-hour one-way drive is too far. Using SkySafari to find low light-pollution areas, Gaode or Xingzhe for altitude info, and PhotoPills for framing, I decided on Fuyang. ※ Lastly, I wish everyone success in capturing the Milky Way and their desired photos! ※ #HaveYouRushedForMilkyWaySeason [Vote]# ※ #Hangzhou[Topic]# #HangzhouMilkyWay[Topic]# #MilkyWay[Topic]# #MilkyWaySeason[Topic]# #MilkyWayArch[Topic]# Find locations, bus, subway.
