Four Pitfalls Coke Chicken Wings, \nPopular Comments: Without oil it will stick to the pan; Not everyone has a non-stick pan; Adding brown sugar! Wouldn't that be too sweet? What about soy sauce?; Coke is already sweet enough, adding brown sugar turns it into an English dessert🍮 [sly laugh]; [crying laugh] Lemons are acidic, tasting sour due to citric acid which remains acidic even though it metabolizes into water and carbon dioxide, ultimately leaving alkaline salts, making it an alkaline food. But its acidity is undeniable and can irritate the upper digestive tract, so let's stop arguing hhh; Look at my Coke chicken wings, give me some encouragement please![flying kiss].",

Researchers have found that if the human body does not eat for 16 hours, it will automatically activate two functions. The first function starts when a person has been fasting for 10 hours, at which point the liver's glycogen is depleted, and then the sugar and fat in the blood begin to be digested, so real weight loss begins after fasting for 10 hours. When fasting reaches 16 hours, another very important function of the body is activated, namely autophagy. Autophagy means 'eating oneself,' a function that has gradually been clarified in recent years., \nPopular Comments: Yes, it works. In the past three months, I've been eating only one meal a day (around 10 am), and now I've lost 30 pounds!

I felt like I was about to go, so I immediately asked my husband to take me to the hospital. In the taxi, I was in excruciating pain, feeling like I was about to die. The doctor at the hospital quickly placed me on a bed and gave me oxygen along with ECG and blood tests. During the wait, the panic slightly eased but still felt very uncomfortable. It was around 2-3 AM when the doctor told me to relax and try sleeping, but I feared falling asleep thinking I might not wake up. After the doctor said that the ECG and blood tests were fine except for a slight potassium deficiency, they administered an IV drip. By dawn, the doctor let me go home to rest without prescribing any medication. That's when my anxiety disorder with somatic symptoms began. My body started to feel inexplicable discomforts such as palpitations, heart discomfort, and shortness of breath. I thought it was a heart problem, so I saw a cardiologist, had an ultrasound, and wore a 24-hour ECG, but no issues were found. Despite this, various symptoms continued, making me increasingly anxious, fearing I had some undiagnosed serious illness. At this peak of panic, almost daily panic attacks occurred. Going to work, just four or five bus stops away, became unbearable during the 🤗 period. Once on the bus, I felt suffocated, fearing fainting with no one to help. I took frequent leaves from work. Later, after numerous tests including colonoscopy, MSG, chest CT scan, all came back normal. One day, while commuting to work, I felt extremely tight-chested and completely out of breath. Luckily, a famous hospital was nearby, so I rushed there via taxi and sought emergency care. An immediate ECG showed no problems. The doctor suggested I see a psychiatrist for possible anxiety disorder with somatic symptoms. Only then did I learn about this condition and found many similar cases online and on Xiaohongshu. Eventually, I chose a combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine treatment from a well-known TCM doctor specializing in mental health issues. Throughout the long treatment journey, despite occasional symptoms, I gradually accepted them knowing nothing was seriously wrong. Gradually, symptoms decreased until now, only occasionally experiencing scalp tension, jaw clenching, or mild chest tightness, which are much better compared to initial panic attacks., \nCover Image OCR Information: None, \nPopular Comments: I'm just like the author, taking Western medicine for 2 years! Recently stopped, occasional episodes occur, but knowing it won't kill me, I slowly accept and adapt...; To everyone who experiences anxiety and panic attacks: I love you. [red heart][red heart][red heart] Everything will be okay!; I didn't have a sense of impending death; during an episode, I experienced limb numbness, a rush of blood to the head, then rapid heartbeat followed by fear. After recent episodes and checks, a 24-hour dynamic test detected second-degree atrioventricular block once, reaching pacemaker installation criteria. Further hospital tests and three days of monitoring showed no second-degree block again, just a heart rate of 164; Anxiety and depression really can't consume coffee or other nerve-stimulating substances; Sisters, do you usually enjoy coffee or milk tea?",

Round, square, oval, with light or without? Watch this video and you'll understand! Today is another day for Big Face to help everyone avoid pitfalls and save money~\n1⃣️ Irregular shape makeup mirror without light——💣💣💣💣\nThis type of mirror is strong in design and looks good in photos, but it is not practical. Embossed design cannot be folded and takes up space. Various oddly shaped mirror surfaces are not suitable for makeup.\n2⃣️ Square rechargeable touch-screen LED makeup mirror——💣💣💣💣💣\nThe touch button switch LED lights are usually quite useless, and the buttons are not responsive; rechargeable lighted makeup mirrors are also inconvenient, providing a poor experience; the thick and non-foldable body takes up space and is difficult to store.\n3⃣️ Rechargeable double-sided magnifying LED makeup mirror——💣💣💣\nThe quality is decent, but like the previous one, the size is too large and non-foldable. The round base does not fit well on a square desk and it requires charging, leading to a bad experience. (Not suitable for dorm use; consider it if your desk is large.)\n4⃣️ Foldable non-lighted makeup mirror——✅\nClear, undistorted imaging; the mirror is very thin and rectangle-shaped, foldable, and very easy to store. It can be placed on a desk, in a drawer, or on a shelf; it can be placed horizontally, vertically, flat, or upright. Using it with a study lamp does not affect the makeup experience.\n\n🎀 Life in a dormitory has many restrictions, don't cause trouble for yourself. Let mirrors do what they are meant for and let desk lamps do what they are meant for. Less is more!\n\n🎀 Feel free to share suggestions and questions in the comments section for friendly exchanges~\nIn the next session, I will tell everyone how to buy storage items for dorm clothing!

First learn to absorb side light. Place the magnet edge parallel to the nail and draw an arc up and down, swipe a few more times; Yan Ling’s store also sells fine magnetic powder, which absorbs better.

On the evening of August 3rd, the baby started having a low-grade fever at around 37.8 degrees. On the morning of August 5th, the fever rose to 38.5 degrees around 5 a.m., so we went directly to the emergency department at Tongji Hospital. The doctor said it might be related to the vaccine and asked us to go home and monitor. So, we went back home. Whenever the baby's fever was above 38.5 degrees, we gave him Motrin. The temperature would drop in about half an hour, but it could only be controlled for four hours. On the morning of August 6th, the baby had a fever of 39.9 degrees. We went back to Tongji Hospital. This time, the doctor did a finger blood prick. After seeing the results, we were admitted to the hospital directly. The C-reactive protein was very high…\nOn the first day in the hospital, a series of blood tests were needed, requiring six vials of blood. The nurse searched for veins for a long time and ended up inserting the needle in the neck. The baby cried so hard he fainted, and they only managed to draw four vials because no more blood came out afterward. During those two days, he barely nursed, remained feverish, and was very lethargic. Even now, I dare not recall the desperate feelings of those moments…\nLater, the doctors administered top-notch antibiotics and glucose. After staying in the hospital for two or three days, the fever subsided, and the baby's state gradually improved. On the 13th, we took him home to stay overnight, thinking we would take him back to the hospital at 6 a.m. the next day without delaying anything. However, on the night of the 13th, the baby developed a fever again. At around 2 a.m., we took him back to the hospital, but we had to wait until the professorial round the next morning to proceed… On the morning of the 14th, before the professor’s round, a doctor asked about the baby’s general condition the day before. At that moment, my husband mentioned discovering some peeling skin on the baby’s fingers and wondered if it was related to the blood pricks. The doctor’s expression changed immediately after hearing this and hurriedly went back to the office, saying they’d discuss it when the professor arrived… Around ten o’clock, the professor came and requested a cardiac ultrasound and more blood tests. They suspected Kawasaki disease. At that moment, we had no idea what Kawasaki disease was, but the news hit us like a thunderbolt out of the blue…\nIn the afternoon, the baby was given a small sedative before undergoing a cardiac ultrasound. The results showed vascular dilation, and Kawasaki disease was confirmed! Back in the ward, they administered intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) while continuing the antibiotics and adding medications for heart and liver protection…\nOn the morning of August 20th, the baby underwent a follow-up cardiac ultrasound. The results were not good. The left coronary artery had not further dilated, but the right side showed dilation with an aneurysm. This made us anxious again. The professor in charge of the baby's bed wasn’t available that day. We waited until the afternoon and then learned from a cardiovascular professor’s consultation to continue the current treatment and do another follow-up in three days. The baby is now only on medications as we’ve stopped IV infusions since it’s nearly impossible to find a vein for injection anymore! During this half-month, I truly felt I am a mother now, with a heavy responsibility to take care of my baby. Although it’s unclear if the Kawasaki disease was caused by the pentavalent vaccine, I’ve decided to think thrice about every decision concerning my child in the future. Back then, my husband had mentioned we should avoid optional vaccines as much as possible. Sigh… Now, I regret it a lot. I made my three-month-old baby suffer so much. I would rather double his pain onto myself to help him bear it…\n, \nOCR information of the cover image: Empty,\nPopular comments: If you didn’t vaccinate, you might feel even guiltier if the baby got infected later. Once a baby gets sick, as parents, it feels like every decision is wrong. I’m not a professional, just a guess: is it possible that the baby already had a congenital heart defect, and the live attenuated vaccine triggered it? If this vaccine wasn’t administered, encountering the virus later might still lead to this — it’s just a matter of time. Parents can’t predict it, so don’t be too hard on yourself. Also, buy critical illness insurance for newborns at birth. Kawasaki disease, as a high-incidence illness among newborns, has a high compensation rate. Best wishes for the baby’s recovery.; Why are people still so ignorant! Choosing optional vaccines! I even hesitate with the free ones!! When I do vaccinate, I always insist on one dose per shot! Two doses? Never—I’d refuse and file a complaint! Vaccines are all viruses, even if attenuated, injecting them is direct exposure to the virus! Immediately request doctors to proceed with the second batch of IVIG to inhibit vascular inflammation and take aspirin for elevated platelets, along with stomach-protective medication. Don’t hesitate. Missing the golden period will bring lifelong regret!; I just read another mom complain that free AC meningitis vaccines caused hearing loss [DisappointedR][DisappointedR][DisappointedR]; Vaccines are only a triggering factor. Many children with Kawasaki have varying underlying causes. My baby developed it at eight months because my husband’s teenage brother came over for summer vacation and fell sick, infecting the baby. The fever lasted three days, and neither antibiotics nor other measures worked; C-reactive protein was high. Due to a rash, the ER doctor suspected Kawasaki disease. At least there’s an effective treatment for this illness, so it’s a tough but manageable situation. Dear parents, please don’t carry too much psychological burden. Be attentive but don’t always stick to just observing as doctors recommend. Observation often delays treatment …",

Does anyone have any recommendations for comfortable Birkenstock shoes? Warnings are welcome too. #Shoes #BirkenstockShoes #ShoeAddict #PinkTax #CollegeStudent #Affordable , \nHot comments are: devo I guess, bought four pairs already[cry-laughing emoji]; These I can wear for life; Bought on TikTok, wore them for half a year without creases.; You must buy thick soles from AnAn's store, super worth it[thumbs-up emoji]; I know the answer to this! Everyone recognizes this! My brother bought a fake Apple EarPods from a certain seller, and my husband has the authentic one, but they look exactly the same. Out of curiosity, my brother and husband compared the sound quality, and it's at least 85% similar. My husband uses his every day and charges it about once every 2 days, while my brother charges his every 3 or 4 days. After seeing this, I got one for myself—it's amazing! Hahaha.",
