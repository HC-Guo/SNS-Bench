The key is to choose varieties with a long harvest period, high yield, and can be eaten for two to three months.\n🍆1. Eggplant, suitable for planting in early spring and early autumn, sow seeds in January-February in spring, and can be harvested from April to June; sow seeds in July-August in autumn, and harvest from October to December.\n🌶️2. Chili peppers, usually seedlings are raised between January 15th and February 15th in spring, and can be planted around mid-March. The temperature at this time is neither hot nor cold, which is conducive to the growth of chili peppers and can also increase their yield.\n🍃3. Buddha's hand melon, has poor cold resistance, usually planted in April-May each year. It takes 170 days from sowing to flowering, and generally 15-20 days after flowering, young melons can be harvested, and 40-50 days for the fruit to fully mature. A well-managed plant can produce hundreds of fruits.\n🍃4. Green beans, planted in spring and autumn. Spring planting time is February-April, earlier in the south, and can be done in April-May in the north. Autumn planting time is usually August-September, but in southern regions where the temperature is still high, it can be postponed to September-October.\n🥒5.

The advantage is that there is no need to wait, I can open the box directly after getting it, and then use it directly when I go to the music festival on Sunday.\n😕 Asked the staff here and confirmed that there is no small yellow flag here. In fact, compared to the light stick, I think the small yellow flag is the soul, the original intention, but having is better than nothing, now I can also have a light stick to go to the rock music festival, cheer on site\n\n‼️ Currently, only the second floor is open for shopping, when I went, there were very few people, there were three staff members, but maybe only one or two customers, which made me feel like I was in the wrong place, how could there be so few people?

He, originally a tough guy on the screen, unexpectedly became inseparably linked with the label of 'sissy' due to a deep portrayal in a TV series. This was not just a role-play, but rather a jest of fate, leading him on a foggy journey of self-redemption and breakthrough amidst applause and skepticism.\nThe character Er Ya Tou in 'Dog Stick', a role that subverts traditional gender norms, is like a stone thrown into a lake, causing ripples upon ripples. Yu Yi, with his exquisite acting skills, brought this character to life, but also found himself lost in the ocean of roles. When the curtain fell and the crowd dispersed, he realized that he seemed to still be immersed in the world of Er Ya Tou, with that delicacy and tenderness clinging to him like a bone worm, hard to let go.\nThus, an exploration of identity, role, and self quietly unfolds.

If the owner does not notice in time, there is a high probability of danger, so we need to promptly provide the hamster with good insulation measures such as paper cotton. When the hamster feels cold, it will curl up into a ball, and may even shiver all over, we can observe carefully. Actually, when the indoor temperature is below 18 degrees, we should start insulating the hamster. We can lay some thick bedding, put some insulation paper cotton, and when the indoor temperature drops below 10 degrees, arrange a cotton nest for the hamster, or put some cotton balls. Owners must pay attention to the condition of the hamster to prevent it from entering pseudo-hibernation.\nAlso, owners should be careful not to let the hamster experience sudden cold and hot temperatures, otherwise the hamster may catch a cold.\nGolden hamsters do not hibernate but can pseudo-hibernate! When the environment is too cold and food is scarce, golden hamsters will enter a state of pseudo-hibernation. After the body enters pseudo-hibernation, the golden hamster's body will struggle to sustain for a long time due to lack of food and low temperatures, leading to death! Therefore, once a golden hamster shows signs of pseudo-hibernation, it needs to be awakened immediately and provided with a warm, food-rich environment. But in most cases, it is almost equivalent to a dead end, so to avoid hibernation, winter insulation must be paid attention to and the condition of the hamster must be observed in time!\nPaper cotton and shavings are essential bedding for hamsters! Hamsters are heavy users of bedding all year round, so don't worry about buying too much for winter use!! Feel free to stock up, boldly stock up. Shavings and paper cotton can raise the temperature for hamsters, reducing the chance of colds and sneezing. The key is that in a warm environment, hamsters reduce the probability of pseudo-hibernation!

Today, we will answer several questions that many of you are concerned about [Magnifying Glass R]\n\nQ1. What does the Level 3 Interpreting exam cover?\n\nA1: The Level 3 Interpreting exam consists of three major categories (6 sub-items), which are two sight translations, two monologue consecutive interpretations, and two monologue simultaneous interpretations. Each category includes one English-to-Chinese and one Chinese-to-English item.\n\nQ2. Is it necessary to obtain the NAATI Level 2 Interpreting certificate before taking the Level 3 Interpreting exam?\n\nA2: No.\nAs long as you meet the eligibility requirements (see the NAATI official website for details), you can directly register for the Level 3 Interpreting exam.\n\nHowever, to obtain the Level 3 Interpreting certificate, you must hold the Level 2 Interpreting certificate. In other words, even if you pass the Level 3 Interpreting exam, you still need to obtain the Level 2 Interpreting certificate before you can finally receive the Level 3 Interpreting certificate. You can choose to take the Level 2 exam first and then the Level 3 exam, or vice versa.\n\nQ3. Must I take the Level 2 Interpreting course before enrolling in the Level 3 Interpreting course?\n\nA3. No.\nYou can directly enroll in the Level 3 Interpreting course. Upon successful completion of the course, you will be eligible to register for both the NAATI Level 2 and Level 3 Interpreting exams.\n\nQ4. If I only enroll in the Level 3 Interpreting course, do I need additional training specifically for the Level 2 Interpreting exam before taking it?\n\nA4: No.\nOur Level 3 Interpreting course includes a specific unit targeting the dialogue translation required for the Level 2 Interpreting exam, providing sufficient training, so there is no need for additional training specifically for the Level 2 Interpreting exam.\n\nQ5. How long is the Level 3 Interpreting course? If I have already studied Level 2, can I skip some parts of the content?\n\nA5: The course duration is 52 weeks, including 12 weeks of holidays. If your Level 2 Interpreting diploma is PSP50922 Diploma of Interpreting, the same units can be directly credited through credit transfer.\n\nWe will continue to update the detailed explanation of the Level 3 Interpreting exam in the next issue.

That is, under the condition of a catalyst, the sample is digested with concentrated sulfuric acid to convert organic nitrogen into inorganic ammonium salts, and then under alkaline conditions, the ammonium salts are converted into ammonia, which is distilled out with steam and absorbed by an excess of boric acid solution, and then titrated with standard hydrochloric acid to calculate the nitrogen content in the sample. Since the nitrogen content in proteins is relatively constant, the protein content can be calculated from its nitrogen content, making this method a classic quantitative method for proteins.\n[Red BookR] When using this method to determine the sample, it needs to go through three processes: digestion, distillation, and titration.\n[Right ArrowR] The instrumental scheme adopted is:\n① Peiou Digestion Furnace + Peiou Automatic Kjeldahl Nitrogen Determinator + Manual Titration\n② Peiou Digestion Furnace + Peiou Fully Automatic Kjeldahl Nitrogen Determinator with Integrated Distillation and Titration\n[HandshakeR] Shanghai Peiou specializes in the production of Kjeldahl nitrogen determinators,\nPeiou is one of the drafting units of the national standard for Kjeldahl nitrogen determinators,\nand holds multiple intellectual property rights, with its headquarters in Shanghai.\nSpecializes in the production of\nFully Automatic Kjeldahl Nitrogen Determinator\nInfrared Quartz Digestion Furnace (Digestor)\nFully Automatic Karl Fischer Moisture Meter\nMicroplate Reader\nWashing Machine\nSoil Cation Exchange Capacity Detector\nFat Analyzer (Soxhlet Extractor)\nSulfur Dioxide Distillation Apparatus\nIntegrated Distillation Apparatus",

The road of renovation is long, and many people find the issue of sink installation troublesome. You want to install an undermount sink but worry about the weight-bearing capacity. You want good weight-bearing but find cleaning the countertop sink inconvenient. Today, I'll summarize the pros and cons of the three installation methods: countertop, undermount, and flush-mount, hoping it will be helpful to everyone.\n\n[Check-in R]【Countertop Sink】\nPros: The easiest and most convenient to install, just place the sink directly on the pre-cut hole in the countertop and fill the gaps with silicone. It's also easy to replace the sink later;\nCons: The silicone seams are prone to mold and blackening, affecting aesthetics. Water stains around the sink are not easy to wipe into the sink.\n[Check-in R]【Flush-Mount Sink】\nPros: Easy to clean, no need to worry about weight-bearing issues, and relatively easy to replace the sink later;\nCons: The installation process is more complex, and there's an additional cost for platform polishing, which greatly tests the installer's skill. There are still dead corners between the sink and the platform, which are prone to dirt and bacterial growth, making it difficult to clean.\n[Check-in R]【Undermount Sink】\nPros: The most aesthetically pleasing and easy to clean, you can sweep dirt from the countertop directly into the sink, and it looks integrated with the countertop, simple and elegant!\nCons: The installation of undermount sinks is more complex. Not only do you need to use silicone, but to solve the weight-bearing issue of the sink, you also need to install brackets to fix the sink and countertop. The brackets will take up space inside the cabinet, which may not leave enough room for the water purifier and garbage disposal.\nSo, the specific choice of sink installation depends on your usage habits and acceptance level.\n#Sink[Topic]##Renovation[Topic]##Kitchen Renovation[Topic]##Sink Installation Method[Topic]##Enhancing Happiness[Topic]##Renovation Pitfalls[Topic]##Large Single Sink[Topic]#",

        "content": "The fastest way to improve in Go 📚 without any alternatives, avoid detours! \nParents, before children reach amateur 5 dan, it's really not about talent [laugh-cry R] it all depends on their own efforts and learning methods. \n\n✅ As a Go teacher for so many years, the most headache-inducing questions are often like these: \n\n1️⃣ Can the teacher judge if my child has talent in Go? \n\n2️⃣ What's the use of learning Go? When can they get an athlete certificate? If they can't get it, it feels like learning it is useless. \n\n3️⃣ I ask him to do more than 30 life-and-death problems every day, and there's no effect after persisting for several months. \n\n4️⃣ My child has a high willingness to learn Go, but I don't want him to continue. \n\n☂️ For such questions, Teacher Wang summarizes a few methods for everyone, hoping to help those confused about learning Go: \n\n🌟 To learn Go well, set clear goals \nWhether it's specific skill level goals or daily training goals, learning Go, like any subject, requires time investment to see results. Without a solid foundation, it's impossible to go far. The amount of weekly games, life-and-death problems, and review sessions, etc... If you want to learn well and achieve results, this is a prerequisite. \n\n🌟 Participate in competitions as much as possible \nThe learning of Go is a continuous process of upgrading and promoting. Children learning Go is completely different from adults. Children's time is very limited ⚠️ In some areas, there are only 1-2 Go upgrade and promotion tournaments a year, each very precious, so participate more. \n\n🌟 In the mid to late stages of learning, it's about the depth of knowledge \nIf at a certain stage, there's a problem with getting stuck and not being able to advance, it's actually due to weak knowledge points in a certain area, not mastering or learning it solidly. Therefore, specialized training is needed. Just spending time on repetitive basic knowledge lessons doesn't have much significance [cover face R] \n\n🌟 Review is very important, from practice to competition \nLearning Go must develop a habit of deep review, from major Go competitions to every game played ✌️ Generally, reviewing 1-2 times a week is the basics. It's usually recommended to directly find a teacher, as it's hard for parents to handle this part. \n\n🌟 Don't blindly grind life-and-death problems in Go \nBlindly doing a large number of life-and-death problems can have many issues: such as the problems being too simple, solving them by feel without serious calculation, etc. Generally, it's recommended that children persist in doing 20-30 minutes of life-and-death problems daily, without spending too much time grinding. \n\n[plant grass R] For children learning Go, parents shouldn't be too anxious. As long as the method is right, the results won't be wrong. If the method is wrong, efforts are in vain. \n\n🌟 I am Wang Roran, a professional 2-dan, thank you for your attention. Currently, there are online Go classes available, welcome to inquire. \n\n#Go [topic]# #Go Learning [topic]# #Go Teacher [topic]# #Professional Player [topic]# #Professional Player Teaching [topic]# #Go Youth [topic]# #Go Competition [topic]# #Go Promotion [topic]# #Go Teaching [topic]# #Children's Go [topic]# #Roran Go [topic]# #Beijing Go [topic]# #Shanghai Go [topic]#",

Under the NSA branch, almost no manufacturer provides EN-DC combos on their official website. And for overseas plans, especially cheap plans and prepaid ones for tourists, only NSA permissions are available.\n\nEN-DC, which stands for EUTRA NR Dual-Connectivity, by definition requires simultaneous connection to EUTRA and NR, meaning LTE and NR dual-linking. Due to differences in radio frequency front-end hardware used by various manufacturers, and to prevent cross-border grey market activities, manufacturers have adopted the practice of 'castrating' EN-DC combos through both hardware and software.\n\nCombo is short for combination. For example, the EN-DC combo for China Mobile is 3-n41, which uses band3 LTE as an anchor point while connecting to the n41 5G frequency band. A phone manufacturer can claim that their product supports the n41 frequency band.\n\nMany people see that the frequency band for T-Mobile in the US is also n41 and think that the phone can be used there. However, T-Mobile's combo is 2-n41 or 66-n41. If a phone is not configured with this combination, even if it supports n41, it cannot connect to this EN-DC 5G network. Of course, this example is not the best because T-Mobile has already commercialized SA, so using SA single frequency is actually okay. This is just an example, as currently very few operators support SA.\nSurely someone will ask, how can I find out about these combos? The only way currently is to purchase the phone, enable modem log, and then use Qualcomm's internal software to unpack the log and view it. Some third-party databases are incomplete, and many new phones are not listed. Therefore, manufacturers can freely 'castrate' these combos without being noticed.\n\n#Traveling Abroad[Topic]# #Studying Abroad[Topic]#",

You must follow my five steps for inspecting the laptop, because today I happened to help a fan who took the college entrance exam disassemble a y9000x, so I will take this opportunity to teach everyone how to inspect a laptop.\nFirst, you must check the outer packaging of the laptop, look at the label on the side of the box, and verify that the configuration you purchased is correct. Any traces of tampering or modification here are not acceptable. Next, check the seal, which is the anti-tampering mark of the laptop and is difficult to forge. We directly tear it open to take a look. If there are repeated glue marks, it means the machine was resealed, and you should arrange for a return.\nSecond, check the surface of the laptop. Similarly, we look to see if there are any scratches or fingerprints on its surface, and also check if the screws at the back are loose.\nThird, officially proceed with the power-on inspection. Because Lenovo laptops have a transport mode, they cannot be turned on without being plugged in. If it can be turned on, it is not a new laptop. After plugging in the power, we normally boot up. Remember to skip the network activation here, just like me, hold down shift+f10, and enter this code in the pop-up interface. After pressing enter, you will successfully skip the network connection.\nFourth, hardware inspection. We need to check if the keyboard can type normally, if the camera can operate properly, and also check the laptop's microphone and each interface. Then, change to a solid color background in the settings to check for screen backlight leakage and dead pixels.\nFifth, check the laptop battery. Since we are not connected to the network, this step requires preparing a USB drive in advance. Download a tool box on the new laptop and check the battery's power-on times and cycle time. Generally, there should be no issues within 100 hours.\nThese five steps are all necessary for inspecting a laptop. There are many things that cannot be detected, so it is still recommended that you purchase from official stores to avoid refurbished or touched machines! #Computer Knowledge[Topic]# #New Laptop Inspection[Topic]# #Computer Inspection[Topic]# #College Students[Topic]# #Computer Novices[Topic]# #Lenovo Savior[Topic]# #Shanghai Lenovo Flagship Store[Topic]# @Digital Potato",

With the current rule of law society, most people have some legal knowledge, so it is relatively easy to understand, with low difficulty, suitable for students without much foundation.\n🔥Self-study Exam: 60 points out of 100 to pass\n🔥Assisted Learning: 34 points out of 100 (registered at assisted learning points) can pass faster\n🍭🍭Preparation Tips:\nThe law major in Anhui self-study has more subjects, most of which are offered once a year. Pay extra attention to take these subjects in advance to avoid delaying graduation by a year if you fail. Also, take these specialized courses seriously, review diligently, and strive to pass in one go, or opt for assisted learning to reduce the need for retakes.\n.\n⭕Career Directions:\n✅Civil Service and Public Institution Exams\nFor law graduates, taking civil service and public institution exams is traditionally considered “professionally matched,” with a large number of positions and opportunities.

This refers to children mourning for their fathers, wives and concubines for their husbands, and subjects for their rulers. Of course, the three-year mourning here is not literal, meaning wearing mourning clothes for three years, but gradually changing. For ordinary scholars, burial takes place three months after death. On the day of burial, the Yu sacrifice ceremony is performed. The next day, the Zuiku ceremony is performed, replacing the mourning sacrifice with a auspicious one, at which point the mourner's mourning attire begins to lighten, gradually returning to normal clothes to remind the mourner not to be overly grief-stricken and to adjust their mood in time. After one year, they can basically return to normal clothes, just with some decorative reminders. After the three-year mourning period is over, they can completely return to normal life.\n——\nAdditionally, the \"three-year mourning\" is also regarded as a moral standard. If an official's parent dies, they must immediately resign and return home to observe the three-year mourning. However, with the passage of time, this funeral system has been abolished, and in a few places, the custom still exists that one cannot marry for three years after the death of an elderly family member.\n#Three-Year Mourning[Topic]# #Hangzhou Cemetery[Topic]# #Family Member's Death[Topic]# #Funeral Culture[Topic]# #White Affairs[Topic]# #Hangzhou Cemetery Bai Xiaosheng[Topic]# #Family[Topic]# #Hangzhou Public Cemetery[Topic]# #Hangzhou Public Cemetery Prices[Topic]# #Pain of Family Member's Death[Topic]# #Customs[Topic]# #Shanghai Cemetery[Topic]# #Sadness[Topic]#",

Introduction\nFeline bacterial skin diseases are one of the common health issues in cats, which not only cause discomfort and pain to the cats but may also affect their quality of life. Understanding how to prevent and treat this disease is crucial for cat owners.\nII. Common Types of Feline Bacterial Skin Diseases\n1.\tPyoderma: This is a common bacterial infection, usually characterized by redness, swelling, pustules, and exudate on the skin.\n2.\tSuperficial Folliculitis: Often presents with inflammation and papules around the hair follicles.\nIII. Causes of the Disease\n1.\tSkin Injuries: Such as scratches, bites, or abrasions, which provide an entry point for bacteria.\n2.\tDecreased Immunity: For example, malnutrition, stress, chronic diseases, etc., weaken the cat's resistance to bacteria.\n3.\tParasitic Infections: Such as fleas, lice, etc., which can lead to skin damage and infection.\nIV. Preventive Measures\n1.\tMaintain Good Hygiene: Regularly bathe the cat using mild, cat-friendly bathing products to clean the skin and fur.\n2.\tGroom the Fur: Frequently grooming the cat's fur helps remove dirt, loose hair, and parasites.\n3.\tBalanced Diet: Provide nutritious and balanced food to ensure the cat gets enough vitamins and minerals to maintain a normal immune system.\n4.\tRegular Deworming: Follow the vet's advice to regularly deworm the cat both internally and externally to prevent parasitic infections.\n5.\tReduce Stress: Provide a quiet, comfortable, and stable living environment for the cat to avoid excessive stress.\nV. Treatment Methods\n1.\tTopical Treatment: For mild infections, use external antibacterial washes, ointments, etc.\n2.\tOral Antibiotics: If the infection is more severe, the vet may prescribe oral antibiotics.\n3.\tAddress Underlying Issues: Such as treating parasitic infections, improving malnutrition, etc.\nVI. Care During Treatment\n1.\tMedication as Directed: Ensure the cat is given medication on time and in the correct dosage.\n2.\tWear an Elizabethan Collar: Prevent the cat from licking or scratching the affected area, which could affect the treatment outcome.\n3.\tMonitor the Condition: Closely observe changes in the cat's symptoms, and if the condition worsens or new symptoms appear, seek a follow-up consultation promptly.\nVII. Conclusion\nAlthough common, feline bacterial skin diseases can be effectively managed through preventive measures and timely treatment, allowing most cats to recover. As cat owners, it is essential to always pay attention to the cat's skin condition to ensure their health. #Sphynx Hairless Cat [Topic]# #Hairless Kitten [Topic]# #German Rex Cat [Topic]# #Feline Skin Disease [Topic]# #Sphynx Hairless Cat [Topic]# #German Cat Breeder [Topic]# #Cat [Topic]#",

After reiterating my experience, I questioned the person in charge about why such a situation occurred. It's quite terrifying to think that a stranger could arbitrarily change a customer's information. The person in charge was also unclear about what exactly happened, as a delivery has only one opportunity to modify the receiving address. The final solution proposed was to contact the merchant to resend a new delivery to me.\n\nAround 3 PM the same day, I contacted the merchant to inquire if the postal delivery had contacted them for a resend. I was given a solution that they would intercept the incorrect delivery and resend a new item to me. For now, this matter seems to have come to a close.\n\nHowever, I am still puzzled about which link in the process could have led to such an incredible situation: a person who doesn't know you at all can casually change your recipient information, and both the sender and the recipient are kept in the dark. If it was indeed an input error during the modification of information as the customer service lady mentioned yesterday, then for such a large postal delivery operation to have such a lapse, shouldn't you feel ashamed?\n\nIn any case, I still hold the same view as yesterday: use postal delivery less for sending items if possible... It's really unreliable. Just a few days before this incident, I had a dispute with postal delivery due to a lost item, which ended with a refund. I thought I was already quite unlucky, but then this even more bizarre incident happened... Postal delivery is truly unreliable.\n\n#Delivery Logistics[Topic]# #Delivery[Topic]# #Postal Delivery[Topic]# #Postal Delivery Complaint[Topic]#",

I don't recommend climbing on cloudy days unless you're doing it for exercise. If you're not too picky about weather for photography, you can go. If you want to see if there's a sunset glow or morning glow, you can use the Li Jing Weather app. I originally planned to go back at 5 PM tonight, but seeing a 50% chance of a sunset glow, I decided to give it a try, and unexpectedly encountered a beautiful sunset glow.\nYou can locate Jingshan Park, and generally the map will guide you to get off the bus at the seaside park. Facing the under-construction building, walk right for dozens of meters, and there will be a handrail leading down. Inside, there is a park with a small pond and fountain. Walk forward and up the stairs, and you'll find the entrance. Scan the code for fire prevention registration. It takes about 20 minutes to walk up the stairs to the top. Along the way, you can look back and see the pictures I mentioned, and you can take photos with 5x-10x zoom on your phone.\nIn autumn, the sunset is usually at 5 PM, so you can start climbing at 4 PM and take backlight portraits. After reaching the top, walk forward to the mountain trail. The left path is suitable for shooting sunset glows, and the right path is suitable for shooting sea views.\nNote! The bottom right corner of the first picture is a color-adjusted image to compensate for the lack of autumn in Guangdong, as generally around February, the weather fluctuates and you get a sense of yellow leaves.\n#Describe autumn with one picture[topic]# #Sunset[topic]# #Sea of clouds[topic]# #Beautiful scenery is around us[topic]# #Healing scenery[topic]# #Travel[topic]# #Beautiful scenery during the journey[topic]# #Sharing natural scenery[topic]#",

Orders under the 10 billion subsidy need to be reviewed by the system first. Before the system review is completed, the store cannot click to ship, so there is no need to urge for shipment at this time.\n2. The system generally reviews within about 6 hours, from 8 AM to 8 PM. After the review is completed, some orders that do not meet the requirements are refunded, and the rest will be shipped normally.\n3. What exactly does the review check?

Here are some specific advantages analyzed from various aspects:\n\nCulture\nCultural similarity: China and Japan share many cultural similarities, especially in terms of diet, etiquette, festivals, and social values. For students from Qingdao, adapting to life in Japan may be relatively easier. Additionally, as a coastal city, Qingdao has historically had extensive cultural exchanges with Japan, which gives Qingdao students a certain understanding and affinity for Japanese culture.\n\nGeographical Location\nProximity: The flight time from Qingdao to Japan is relatively short, usually within 2-3 hours, making it convenient for students to return home during holidays.\nTransport convenience: There are frequent flights between Japan and China, with relatively affordable ticket prices, making travel fast and convenient.\n\nValue\nHigh-quality education: Japan boasts many world-renowned universities such as the University of Tokyo, Kyoto University, and Osaka University. The quality of higher education in Japan is widely recognized globally, offering a high degree of value after graduation.\nTechnology and research: Japan leads in research in fields such as technology, engineering, medicine, and humanities, allowing students to access advanced knowledge and technology.\n\nCost-effectiveness\nTuition and living costs: Compared to European and American countries, Japan's tuition and living costs are relatively lower. Japanese universities offer various scholarships and grants, reducing the financial burden on students.\nPart-time job opportunities: Japan allows international students to work part-time during their studies, which not only alleviates financial pressure but also improves Japanese language skills and gains work experience.\n\nEmployment Opportunities\nQingdao is home to numerous Japanese companies, providing extensive employment opportunities for students returning from studying in Japan. Graduates with a background in Japanese education and language skills are more competitive in these companies. Moreover, China and Japan have extensive cooperation in economic fields, especially in trade, manufacturing, and technology. Students can gain relevant experience during their stay in Japan, laying a solid foundation for future career development.\n\nConsidering the above factors, it is a rational and attractive choice for Qingdao students planning to study abroad to choose Japan.

For the 1st to 3rd brews, filter out or soak for 5-10 seconds, from the 4th brew onwards, extend the filtering time by 5 seconds each time. Pu'er tea can be brewed continuously for 8-10 times.\n💡 Advantages?\n**Rich Tea Qi**: Lao Ban Zhang tea has a stable tea Qi, which can slowly reach the nasal cavity, permeate the mouth and throat, while the tongue bottom gushes with spring water, clear and mellow.\n**Bold Taste**: The taste of Lao Ban Zhang tea is very bold, strong and overbearing, with a rapid return of sweetness and saliva production, long-lasting throat rhyme, and a strong, layered aroma.\n**Rich Tea Soup Flavor**: The large tree tea from Lao Ban Zhang village is rich in substances, with a thick tea soup, golden in color, clear and translucent like a gem.\n**High and Persistent Aroma**: The aroma of Lao Ban Zhang tea is high and persistent, with rice, lotus, and honey aromas hidden in the rigid tea soup, clear, elegant, and pure, without any impurities.\n**Good Aftertaste**: Lao Ban Zhang tea has a good aftertaste, studies show that this is related to the content of caffeine and tea polysaccharides in the tea.\n**Heavy Flavor**: Lao Ban Zhang tea is very durable, not limited by brewing methods, and has the characteristic of turning soft into strong when tasting.\n💡 In addition, Lao Ban Zhang tea also has characteristics such as tight strips, fat buds, stable and thick tea aroma, full taste, and strong aftertaste.\n💡 However, it should be noted that the aroma and taste of Lao Ban Zhang tea vary from person to person, some people's taste systems are particularly sensitive to certain components, and may find the taste of some teas overbearing and stimulating.\n💡 Overall, Lao Ban Zhang tea is an outstanding quality Pu'er tea with rich taste and aroma characteristics, good aftertaste, and high durability.\nBut it also needs to be appreciated according to personal taste preferences.\n\n🍃 Follow us, share tea culture knowledge with you every day 🍃\n#Share Tea Knowledge Spread Tea Culture[Topic]# #Brew a Good Pot of Tea[Topic]# #Tea Life[Topic]# #Tea[Topic]# #Lao Ban Zhang[Topic]# #Pu'er Tea[Topic]#",

        "query": "Professional Terms for Pu'er Tea Taste",
        "content": "Taste Characteristics of Aged Pu'er Tea:\nAged Pu'er Tea\nTaste Characteristics:\nThickness: Aged Pu'er tea has a full-bodied and textured mouthfeel, with rich and delicate broth, aromatic and not insipid.\nSmoothness: The tea broth enters the mouth smoothly, comfortable to drink, and pleasing.\nMoistness: Upon entry, the aged tea moistens the throat, providing a warm, comfortable, and refreshing sensation.\nSweetness: The taste is sweet and aromatic, with a high level of sweetness that is long-lasting.\nMellow: Rich and authentic, the mellowness of aged Pu'er tea offers a pure natural enjoyment. Using 'sweet, mellow, moist, thick, smooth' as criteria for judging good aged tea, any aged tea that meets three or more of these criteria in daily tasting can provide a pleasant drinking experience.\nI. Thickness\nWhen the tea broth enters the mouth, the fullness and texture in the oral cavity is what we call the thickness of the tea broth. This thickness refers to the substantial feel of the broth, with the tea broth feeling cohesive in the mouth, not insipid.\nII. Smoothness\nThe smooth entry of the tea broth into the mouth is a sensation it gives to the oral cavity. Some tea broths can feel rough upon entry, and even cause a dry throat after drinking. A smooth broth indicates that it does not dry or irritate the mouth, providing a comfortable sensation. Such a mouthfeel is often found in palace-grade and first-grade materials with more buds.\nIII. Moistness\nGood aged Pu'er tea moistens the throat upon entry, immediately relieving any dryness. Experienced tea connoisseurs highly value the characteristic of throat moistness. This moistness is essential for aged Pu'er, with high-quality aged Pu'er leaving a feeling of warmth and smoothness like jade, as if bathed in spring breeze!\nIV. Sweetness\nSweetness is perhaps the simplest and most intuitive aspect of evaluating aged tea. Good aged tea can be smelled for its sweet aroma even before the broth enters the mouth. Upon contact with the tongue, the sweetness can be quickly felt and spreads throughout the mouth, lasting long.\nV. Mellow\nThe mellowness of Pu'er tea is often described together with thickness and authenticity. Rich and authentic describe the broth as it slides into the mouth, free of any miscellaneous or odd flavors, clean and pure. The mellowness of aged Pu'er tea provides a pure natural enjoyment.\nSummary\nSweetness mainly manifests as entry sweetness and aftertaste. As Pu'er tea ages, the amount of soluble sugars in the broth increases, making the entry sweetness more pronounced and enhancing the aftertaste performance.\nThe sweetness of the tea broth is not only a criterion for judging the palatability of aged tea but also reflects the fermentation skill level of the tea to some extent.\nMellow and thick refer to the broth being substantial and full-bodied. When an aged tea has a good broth texture, we often say it is 'as mellow as rice broth'.\nThe performance of the aged tea broth is mainly determined by the content of substances within the tea leaves and the storage age.#Pu'er Aged Tea [Topic]#",

My mom chose the standard teeth cleaning, but I insisted on the comfortable teeth cleaning.\nI really needed to get my teeth cleaned. Before this, I checked a lot about whether to go to a hospital or a clinic. The hospital requires blood tests and X-rays, and the waiting time for teeth cleaning is longer. Clinics don't take blood, which is not safe, but there's no waiting. I even took a day off to rest and prepare for the teeth cleaning the next day, but ended up chickening out and not leaving the house.\n\nMom said she would treat me to the standard teeth cleaning [doge] No no no...

        "content": "Clarifying everything about [Import Tariff]\n[One R] What is Import Tariff?\nImport tariff refers to the taxes levied by the country on imported goods, aimed at protecting the domestic market and regulating import and export trade. The object of tariff collection is imported goods, and the tax rate is determined based on the type of goods, country of origin, net weight, quantity, and other information.\n\n[Three R] What is Import Value-Added Tax?\nImport value-added tax is a tax levied on the value-added portion generated in the circulation of goods after they enter the domestic market. Simply put, it is how much the value of the goods has increased compared to similar domestic goods after import, and this added value needs to be taxed.\n\n[Three R] How to Calculate Import Tariff and Value-Added Tax?\n1️⃣ Calculation of Import Tariff: The formula for calculating import tariff is: Tariff Amount = Duty-Paid Price x Tariff Rate. Here, the duty-paid price is the price of the goods determined by customs based on factors such as type, quality, quantity, and country of origin, while the tariff rate is the tax rate determined based on the type, quality, and country of origin of the goods.\n2️⃣ Calculation of Import Value-Added Tax: The formula for calculating import value-added tax is: Value-Added Tax Amount = (Duty-Paid Price + Tariff Amount) x Value-Added Tax Rate. Here, (Duty-Paid Price + Tariff Amount) represents the total value of the goods, i.e., the total cost after import, and the value-added tax rate is determined based on the relevant national policies.\n\n[Four R] Actual Case Demonstration\nTaking an imported watch as an example, with a duty-paid price of 10,000 yuan, a tariff rate of 30%, and a value-added tax rate of 17%. Then, the import tariff and value-added tax to be paid for this watch are:\nTariff Amount = 10,000 yuan x 30% = 3,000 yuan\nValue-Added Tax Amount = (10,000 yuan + 3,000 yuan) x 17% = 2,210 yuan\nTherefore, the total import tariff and value-added tax to be paid for this watch upon import is 5,210 yuan. #Import [Topic]# #Tax Payment [Topic]# #Tariff [Topic]#",

Perhaps many people know that supermarkets or convenience stores sell dried sweet potatoes, but few buy them to eat.\nThe plain-looking and simple-tasting dried sweet potatoes are a very delicious food. Once you try them, you will be addicted to their just-right sweetness and won't be able to quit.\nThe advantage of dried sweet potatoes is that they are not too sweet and easy to eat, and they also have a good texture, which can make people feel full.\nDried sweet potatoes are a nutritious food and are also effective for weight loss. So, besides being beneficial to health, what other effects do dried sweet potatoes have?\nHow many calories are in dried sweet potatoes?\nWhen you first start eating them, the moderately sweet dried sweet potatoes are very tasty, and you will unconsciously eat a lot.\nRegarding the calories contained in dried sweet potatoes, every 100 grams of dried sweet potatoes contains about 300 calories.\nThe sugar content in dried sweet potatoes is high, and the calories are not low, so people who are losing weight should not use dried sweet potatoes as a meal, but as a nutritional supplement during weight loss, to eat when they are hungry. This can achieve good results without hindering weight loss.\nNutritional components contained in dried sweet potatoes\nIn dried sweet potatoes, which are beneficial to health, there are large amounts of vitamins B1, C, and E, which are essential for beauty.\nIn addition to vitamins, they also contain minerals such as iron and potassium, which are easily deficient, and dietary fiber that effectively relieves constipation. Dried sweet potatoes are a simple and nutritious food.\nWhat are the benefits of eating dried sweet potatoes?\nSolve constipation\nDried sweet potatoes are made by drying sweet potatoes, so the nutrients in dried sweet potatoes are concentrated.\nThe amount of dietary fiber in dried sweet potatoes is twice that of regular sweet potatoes, so it is very effective in relieving constipation.\nWeight loss\nChewy dried sweet potatoes do not require a lot to eat. Just chew them slowly, and a small amount can make you feel full.\nEating too many dried sweet potatoes is not effective for weight loss, but the moderate sweetness of dried sweet potatoes will not make you feel stressed during the weight loss process.

Because my long-worn earrings fell off, I happened to be at Changsha IFS, and my husband said he would buy a pair for me.\nPreviously, the staff at Gucci and Dior, knowing I don't buy bags, were still very polite to me, introducing items, disinfecting, and letting me try on...\nWhen we got to Hermes, we were greeted by a male clerk who seemed normal at first. I asked if they had the white one in the picture, and he said it was out of stock. I asked if I could try on this one, and he said Hermes emphasizes personal hygiene and doesn't allow try-ons. Okay, I can understand that... Later, I asked if I could just hold it for comparison, and he gave it to me, and I was quite satisfied.\nWhen I asked the price, he said 4000+, and I casually asked if there were any discounts now (I thought this was normal), and he gave me a very exaggerated expression, eyes wide, looking at me in disbelief (the expression seemed to say, 'Haven't you ever bought from Hermes? Don't you know we never offer discounts?')\nHe answered me with this expression, 'We at Hermes never have discounts,' and honestly, I was speechless on the spot...\nHe could have simply told me calmly, even firmly, that there were no discounts, and I wouldn't have been angry. But he had to use this disgusting attitude. Besides, what's wrong with haggling over a 4000+ item? Can't I haggle? Buying a 4000+ item but not getting 4000 worth of service.\nIn the end, after visiting a few stores, my husband saw that I still liked it and bought it, but I won't visit Hermes again.

The only consolation is that due to the relentless hunting and capturing by Western colonizers over several centuries, Barbary lions were once kept in noble estates and zoos across European countries. Many hybrid Barbary lions have also survived to this day. However, this is not an honor but rather a living indictment of the crimes committed by colonizers in the past.\nRegarding the Barbary lion, the biggest misconception among the general public is likely about its size. In many 'popular science articles,' it is claimed that the Barbary lion is the largest lion, with male average weights of 270 or even 300 kilograms, a full one-third larger than the existing African lions. Its combat power is said to completely overwhelm the Northeast Tiger, making it the strongest feline. It is indeed hard to say who is stronger between lions and tigers, and of course, we dare not claim either.

Some say it's pork neck meat (also known as Matsubara meat or 'Golden Eight Ounces'), some say it's second-layer meat, some say it's rib meat, some say it's plum blossom meat, and some even joke about it being a mix of beef and pork😆...\n\nRegarding the piece of meat I bought a few days ago, my mother-in-law explained that it is second-layer meat, not pork neck meat~ Since I don't fully understand this piece of meat myself, I asked my mother-in-law [winking face] who went to the market early this morning and bought some second-layer meat and pork neck meat (pork neck meat comes from different parts, and she only got one piece)⬇️\n\nPic 3️⃣-6️⃣: This is the piece of meat everyone has been discussing~ It's called 'second-layer meat'! It looks very similar to the well-known pork neck meat! But it's from a different part~ This piece is from the front leg of the pig, nestled between the fatty pork layers~ Since every pig is unique, the fat and lean patterns of this meat vary.

After removing the lymph nodes and thyroid glands, you get this delicious piece of meat~ This is why some people mistakenly think it's lymphatic meat, but it's safe to eat once cleaned properly~\n\nPic 8️⃣-9️⃣: This might be less common for everyone to see? This is also 'pork neck meat'! Also known as 'Crisp Meat'. My mother-in-law says this is the most premium meat of the pig~ This part is located at the back of the pig's neck, connecting to the front leg~\n\n⁉️Regarding the price: These pieces of meat are rare parts of the pig, so it's best to buy them early. The price is slightly higher than other parts, and there may be slight variations in different places, but it's generally around ¥25-30\n\n⁉️I am located in Puning, Guangdong~ The local pork quality in the meat market is very good~ My mother-in-law says that pigs with long tails are local pigs, while those with short tails are from other places~ There may be differences in the origin and breed of pigs in different cities, and the meat quality may vary. Each region may have different names for these pieces of meat~ But no matter what it's called, if it tastes amazing, it's a good piece of meat [thumbs up]\n\n‼️Finally, I wish everyone can buy and enjoy their dream piece of meat [laughing face]\nFeel free to comment and share (recommend) your favorite delicious meats (any kind of meat [doge]) Let's drool together🤤 and enjoy big chunks of meat [party face]\n\n[waiting for more H] Next time I'll share a cooking tutorial for this piece of meat~ Stay tuned if you're interested [blowing a kiss]\n#Pork [topic]# #I want to eat meat [topic]# #Price [topic]# #Cooking [topic]# #Delicious [topic]# #Food preparation [topic]# #Serious about cooking [topic]# #Lymphatic meat [topic]# #Pork neck meat [topic]# #Second-layer meat [topic]# #Eating meat [topic]# #Meat lover [topic]# #Snowflake meat [topic]##Science popularization [topic]#",

Monkey heads belong to the walnut family. This is the normal growth structure of the monkey head, looking like two halves extending to the hole. As long as it is a monkey head, it will have growth lines. When the color deepens later, it is not very obvious, and you can play with peace of mind.\n2. Oil return, because there is also flesh inside the monkey head walnut, and the oil content is also very sufficient. The internal structure is complex. Through polishing, the thickness of the nuclear wall is not the same, so it is normal for the oil to come out unevenly, which is also known as the awkward period. Through playing, the oil is volatilized, and the color will be consistent in the later stage. Oil return includes linear, blocky, and even the accumulation of oil that comes out in spots, all of which are normal situations.\n3. Watermelon pattern\nLinear oil return and the watermelon skin you mentioned are two different things. If there must be a flaw called watermelon skin, it is the strip lines formed by the original skin texture, chaff, or white spots on the surface.

It is impossible for the original ecological seeds to have no\nthese oil returns, because the color change of the monkey head is mainly the process of oil return.

I chose Aima since the prices were similar.\nFirst: Battery, make sure to confirm what type of battery it is before buying. Currently, Tianneng and Chaowei are considered good. The boss installed a Tianneng battery for me, at least a big brand ensures quality. Always double-check the brand of the battery to avoid disputes after payment where the boss might substitute a inferior one.\nSecond: Charger, confirm if the charger is original. I didn't check in advance, and the boss gave me a generic brand charger, which I noticed and demanded a replacement on the spot. The boss then claimed it was a mistake. Probably trying to give me a generic one, while the original could sell for 200 yuan.\nThird: Tires, this model has vacuum tires. The boss said they need maintenance every one or two months, and you can get free inflation and tire pressure adjustment at the store.\nFourth: Invoice and license plate. Make sure to understand the local license plate policy to avoid issues with registration. The boss of the store I bought from will assist with the license plate registration, which is free, so don't be deceived. If the boss doesn't help with the registration, make sure to get the vehicle's certificate of conformity and the invoice, otherwise, you won't be able to register.\nFinally, the model I bought is Aima Aiduo QB33, with four Tianneng batteries, 48V20.3a. Different battery sizes have different prices. I paid 2599 yuan, and got a helmet and a raincoat for free, along with a lifetime APP membership, which allows me to unlock the bike and check its location via my phone.

It greatly promotes the aesthetic quotient of the public, with exquisite visuals that are second to none. Initially, I was puzzled why such a niche film would compete with other blockbusters in the National Day market, but after watching it, I understood the reason: a millennium scroll, only this green; even the most brilliant masterpieces cannot be separated from the selfless dedication of the working people. The creation process of 'Thousand Miles of Rivers and Mountains' from conception to completion artistically represents the ancient techniques of weaving, engraving, holding a brush, making colors, and producing ink. Usually, it's movies that get adapted into TV series ('The Message') or stage plays ('Raise the Red Lantern'), but this time a phenomenally successful stage play is turned into a movie, which is indeed rare and a great idea: it fully utilizes the montage technique, composition skills, and cinematic language of film, perfectly combining the aesthetic beauty of dance drama with the visual impact of cinema. The dance movements in the movie are smooth and powerful, especially the classic move 'Green Waist', which through close-up and magnification by the camera, greatly reduces the regret of not being able to appreciate it up close on stage, more vividly showcasing the layered mountains in the painting and the aesthetics of the Song Dynasty. In addition, the movie also includes some supplementary content, such as unrolling the scroll, singing silk, listening to the rain, entering the painting, etc., as well as national treasure-level painting Easter eggs (hints in the latter images), these details make the narrative of the movie more complete and rich. With such mutual assistance and prosperity among stage, TV, and film people, we can better and faster enhance cultural confidence and cultural revival. After all, artists need to eat too, right? However, the movie also loses some of the unique emotions and aesthetics of the dance drama, such as issues with overly fragmented editing. The flaws do not obscure the merits, I initially thought this movie with no dialogue, only dance, poetry, painting, archaeology professionals, or people like Old Zhao who are rich in ancestral artistic bacteria would like it, but it seems that both word of mouth and box office are booming, if it weren't for the limited screenings, it could have made even more money. After watching 'Only This Green', I truly understand: when it comes to playing with art, the charming ancestors of the Zhao family have never lost. #OnlyThisGreen[topic]#",

When I was lying in bed playing with my phone at night, I felt one side of the phone case was lifted. After checking online, I realized it was a battery bulge 😑\nI ran to the phone shop, and the technician told me not to charge or use it, as the temperature might get too high and it could explode. How did everyone solve this issue? [Crying R][Crying R]\nHere are some solutions I found:\n1. The shop recommends replacing the battery core for 200 yuan\n2. There are no direct stores nearby, but there are pick-up points: one for 799 yuan and another for 729 yuan to return to the manufacturer for an original battery replacement, which takes about 1-2 weeks (I want to ask friends who have replaced it how the battery life is and how long it can last?)\n3. The pick-up shop can help replace a Pisen battery for 260 yuan～\n4. The rest of the phone is still good, and I want to use it for a while longer. I bought it in November 2021, 256G. However, some friends say that even if the battery is replaced with an original one from the manufacturer, as long as it has been disassembled, the amount that can be offset when trading in for a new one will be much less. Is that true?\nFriends who have experienced this, what's the best way to handle it? #Apple13[Topic]# #iPhone13[Topic]# #Battery Bulge[Topic]# #Battery Capacity[Topic]# #iPhone13 Battery Bulge[Topic]#\n\n———————————————————————\\\nOn June 4th, after discovering the bulge, I went to a local phone repair shop. The technician said not to fully charge it. Due to personal concerns, I transferred my data to another phone and charged 🪫 to 60% before turning it off and placing it in the phone box, without touching it during that time.\nOn June 16th, when I opened the phone case, I found the bulge was even worse. The phone still had 58% battery when I turned it on. I was about to reset it to factory settings and take it to the pick-up point to send it back to the factory, but the battery level immediately dropped to 10%, and the iPhone shut down automatically before I could restore it. I didn't dare to turn it on and took it to the pick-up point today!\nEveryone should deal with issues early. My phone, even without use, had the bulge gap getting bigger.\n———————————————————————-\nThe phone was sent to a nearby pick-up point for factory repair. It cost 799 yuan, and I don't know why it wasn't 729～. At the pick-up point in Zhejiang, they initially said 729, but when I mentioned my phone had a bulge after 2 years, the store manager said a full device repair was needed, costing over 3000 yuan. Later, at a pick-up point in Fujian, they said 799 yuan for factory return. I sent it on Wednesday, and by Friday morning, they said I could pick it up. There was no repair receipt inside, just like when I gave it to the pick-up point, but the bulge was gone! I noticed the battery record showed it was charged a lot on Thursday! I've uploaded the post-repair photos. Can anyone tell if it's genuine? The pick-up point address was given by the official flagship store.

I summarized the key points: First, the quality of the garlic itself is crucial. The garlic bought from supermarkets is treated to inhibit sprouting, so it's best to buy planting garlic or garlic that has grown in the field without treatment. Second, you need to peel and soak the garlic; unpeeled garlic tends to mold when soaked. Third, during the rooting period, it's best to keep it away from light and maintain a certain temperature.\nSince I couldn't conveniently buy planting garlic, I used the clean, white garlic from the vegetable store, separated the cloves, peeled them all, and soaked them in a black takeout box, placed inside the cabinet. The next day, when I checked, all the garlic cloves had grown dense little roots! The garlic from last time didn't sprout even after a week. Then, there were visible new changes in the garlic cloves every day.\nToday is the fourth day of hydroponics, and the roots of the largest garlic clove have grown to three centimeters, and the garlic sprouts are also two centimeters long.

[Smiling Face with Open Mouth and Smiling Eyes] Interning in major cities inevitably involves the issue of renting. \nWhen renting, one also faces the issue of broadband internet, and many first-time renters, unfamiliar with broadband routers, might be misled by landlords [Angry Face][Angry Face]. For example, after paying rent, you might also need to pay a monthly internet management fee of 100 yuan, or if your room has poor signal, you might need to pay for broadband, router, and annual rental fees, which can add up to several hundred yuan at once! \nMoreover, for young people just entering the workforce, facing job instability and possibly changing jobs and houses frequently [Face with Look of Triumph], getting a broadband connection might not be very cost-effective. \n\nSpending money and effort to set up broadband in a room, only to quit the job shortly after, means the costs for the router, installation, and annual broadband fees are sunk costs...... [Face with Open Mouth] \nFor short-term renters or recent graduates, installing broadband in a rental house is not as good as buying a portable WiFi~ \nWhy is portable WiFi suitable for short-term renters? \n[Keycap 1] Portable WiFi is pay-as-you-go: For example, you normally use portable WiFi in your rental house, but after working for a while, you want to go home and rest for a few months where you have broadband and don't need WiFi. You can stop paying and resume when you rent again, which is the advantage of pay-as-you-go portable WiFi. \n[Keycap 2] Broadband is expensive: Installing broadband in a rental house requires buying a router, paying for installation, and then paying the annual broadband fee. The total cost for a year can be several hundred yuan, which is not very economical. \n[Keycap 3] Portable WiFi is flexible and can be carried around: It can be used not only in the rental house while working but also when going back to the village during holidays. Portable WiFi is compact and convenient to carry around! \n[Keycap 4] Portable WiFi is affordable with flexible plans, for example, if you don't use much data in May, you can choose a 10G plan. In June, if you need more data, you can opt for a 100G or 200G plan based on your needs. \n[Rose] In summary, for short-term renters or recent graduates with unstable jobs, buying a portable WiFi is quite suitable, with flexible plans that can be adjusted as needed, providing a good temporary solution. #wifi #portableWiFi #portableWiFirecommendation #portableWiFiwizard #practicaldigitalskills #networkdevice #YunYiportableWiFi #YunYiWiFi",

        "content": "Folk Stories about Sugar Painting\nUsing a spoon as a pen and melted sugar as ink to depict various things. There is a more vivid and interesting folk story about sugar painting. It is said that during the Tang Dynasty, the great Sichuan poet Chen Ziang had a fondness for yellow sugar (cane sugar) when he was in his hometown. However, his way of eating it was unique. Chen Ziang liked to melt the sugar and then pour it onto a clean, smooth table to form various small animals and floral patterns. After it solidified, he would hold it in his hand, appreciating and eating it at the same time, feeling that it was an elegant and refined pastime. Later, Chen Ziang went to the capital Chang'an to study and seek official positions. Being new to the capital and unfamiliar with the people and places, he only became a minor official. In his leisure time, he used the yellow sugar he brought from his hometown to pass the time in the same manner.\nOne day, while Chen Ziang was appreciating his work, a palace eunuch passing by with the young prince saw the small animals in Chen Ziang's hand and the young prince demanded to have them. When the eunuch found out that these small animals were made of sugar, he took a few for the young prince, who happily returned to the palace. Unexpectedly, after the young prince finished the sugar, he cried and demanded more, which disturbed the emperor. The eunuch had no choice but to truthfully report to the emperor. After hearing the story, the emperor immediately summoned Chen Ziang to the palace and asked him to perform on the spot. Chen Ziang melted the yellow sugar he brought, poured it into the shape of a copper coin, and used a bamboo chopstick to pick it up and hand it to the young prince, who immediately stopped crying and smiled.

        "answer": [
            "There is a more vivid and interesting folk story about sugar painting. It is said that during the Tang Dynasty, the great Sichuan poet Chen Ziang had a fondness for yellow sugar (cane sugar) when he was in his hometown. However, his way of eating it was unique. Chen Ziang liked to melt the sugar and then pour it onto a clean, smooth table to form various small animals and floral patterns. After it solidified, he would hold it in his hand, appreciating and eating it at the same time, feeling that it was an elegant and refined pastime. Later, Chen Ziang went to the capital Chang'an to study and seek official positions. Being new to the capital and unfamiliar with the people and places, he only became a minor official. In his leisure time, he used the yellow sugar he brought from his hometown to pass the time in the same manner.\nOne day, while Chen Ziang was appreciating his work, a palace eunuch passing by with the young prince saw the small animals in Chen Ziang's hand and the young prince demanded to have them. When the eunuch found out that these small animals were made of sugar, he took a few for the young prince, who happily returned to the palace. Unexpectedly, after the young prince finished the sugar, he cried and demanded more, which disturbed the emperor. The eunuch had no choice but to truthfully report to the emperor. After hearing the story, the emperor immediately summoned Chen Ziang to the palace and asked him to perform on the spot. Chen Ziang melted the yellow sugar he brought, poured it into the shape of a copper coin, and used a bamboo chopstick to pick it up and hand it to the young prince, who immediately stopped crying and smiled. The emperor, feeling pleased, blurted out 'Sugar Cake (er),' which is how the name 'Sugar Cake (er)' originated, and as a result, Chen Ziang was promoted to the position of Right Aide.\nLater, after Chen Ziang retired to his hometown, to commemorate the emperor's favor and also because he was bored in his leisure, he took on a few apprentices to teach them this skill. These apprentices passed on the skill to their own apprentices, spreading it far and wide. Some even made it their profession, traveling from village to village to conduct sugar cake businesses.

        "content": "It's said that you can't be too honest in the CET-4 exam 😳\nHere are some tips for reference, no need to memorize, just get the gist 🐴\n✅ Listening Section\n🌟 A total of 25 listening multiple-choice questions, 25 answers include: 6A+6B+6C+6D=24, then ➕ any one of ABCD, finally: 6A+6B+6C+6D+A/B/C/D=25\n🌟 Every 5 options combination:\n2A+B+C+D\n2B+A+C+D\n2C+A+B+D\n2D+A+B+C\n☑️ Meaning: Each group must contain ABCD four options, and one option is repeated. That means if you get two right in each group of five, you can get all five right.\n🌟 Notes‼️\n1️⃣ Regarding invitations from boys to girls, girls always say I want to go, But in the end, they don't go\n2️⃣ If there are two opposite meanings in the answers, one of them must be the answer\n3️⃣ Time choice questions: generally do not choose the time heard directly, there is a process of addition and subtraction.\n4️⃣ Taking a plane/ship: generally need to wait.\n5️⃣ Accidents/disasters: no deaths, but there will be injuries\n✅ Reading Word Filling\n☑️ Word Filling\n🌟 Choose 10 out of 15 words, first mark the 15 words with parts of speech: n,v,adj,adv.\n🌟 Conclusion: Generally, there is only 1 adverb in 10 fill-ins, nouns and verbs are more than 2, and the rest are adjectives.\n☑️ Matching Reading\n🌟 The answers are basically: ABCD+EFGH+IJK structure, remove any excess, letters after K rarely appear, basically one less in ABCD, one less in EFGH, IJK remains unchanged.\n🌟 The answers are basically synonymous replacements, still need to memorize words well, and no need to read the whole text, quickly read and match synonymous keywords\n☑️ Careful Reading\n🌟 Conclusion 1\nTen questions, the answer model is: 2ABCD+any two from ABCD.\n🌟 Conclusion 2\nEach group of five options is: A, B, C, D+A/B/C/D, just the order is mixed up.\n🌟 Notes‼️\n📝 Options that copy the original text are generally not the answer, the answer is often a synonymous replacement of the original text.\n📝 Options that express specific meanings, longer sentences are generally not the answer, while general ones are the answer.\n📝 Options with absolute tone words: must, never, merely, etc. are not the answer, while possible tone words: might, could, etc. are the correct answer.\n📝 If making an inference about a certain paragraph, just summarize that paragraph.\n📝 Options with possible tone words will, may are the correct answers.\n✅ Composition and Translation\n🌟 Translation generally examines Chinese traditional culture, hurry up and memorize a few predicted passages.\n🌟 Composition needs a good template, write a good beginning and ending.\n\nNot much time left for the CET-4, after understanding these tips, hurry up and practice👀\n#Freshman[Topic]# #CET-4[Topic]# #College English CET-4[Topic]# #CET-6[Topic]# #Must Pass CET-6 This Time[Topic]# #CET-6 Strategies[Topic]#",

If you start preparing for postgraduate English exams from the beginning of October, how can you break through the bottleneck and achieve 80 points in three months?\n\n💟1. Vocabulary: Vocabulary is the foundation, persist in memorizing (don't waste too much time in a day, use fragmented time, 40min-1h is enough)\n① Outline vocabulary (3000 high-frequency words) 100-150 words per day\n② Words that appear in the real exams (memorize all unfamiliar words in the first round, check for missing points in the second and third rounds)\n\n💟2. Reading: 2010-2020 eleven years of real exams, one to two articles per day (keep three sets from 2021, 2022, 2023 for later mock exams)\n（First round）the first, read carefully, grasp the main idea of the article, analyze sentence components, review after finishing, the review step is very important, refer to the previous notes❗\n\n（Second round）You can use the electronic version of the real exams, classify and practice, use fragmented time to practice, compare with the first round, check for missing points, listen to detailed explanations of wrong questions until you understand.\n\n💟3. The three smaller subjects\n\n🍀 Translation (recommended teacher Tang Jing)\nEnglish One: Find 5 sentences to translate from an article\nEnglish Two: Translate an entire article\nSpend about 5 days mastering the answering techniques, then start practicing the real exams, initially without time limit, then control each article to 20-25min, after finishing, compare with the answer or listen to video explanations.\n💕Note: ① Seriously compare the differences between your translation and the answer, pay attention to the points where the teacher explains that synonyms cannot be replaced.\n② Be flexible in translation, making the sentences read smoothly.\n\n🍀 New question types (recommended Liu Qi + Xie Binbin)\nEnglish One: Sequence questions > Seven choose five > Subtitles\nEnglish Two: Information matching > Subtitles\nMaster the answering techniques in 2-3 days, then start practicing the real exams, initially without time limit, then control each article to 20-25min, if the questions are simple, you can appropriately reduce the time.\n\n🍀 Cloze (recommended Yi Xiren)\n\nOverall, cloze has a low cost-performance ratio, with a total of 20 questions, each worth 0.5 points, generally control each cloze to 12-15min, don't immediately look up unfamiliar words, mark them, and check after finishing.\n💕Note: ① Although the score for each cloze question is not high, it cannot be ignored!\n② Generally, several blanks in cloze will correspond with the preceding and following text, so accumulate more.\n\n💟4. Writing (recommended teacher Shi Leipeng)\nEnglish One: Small essay 10 points, large essay 20 points\nEnglish Two: Small essay 10 points, large essay 15 points\nTeacher Shi Leipeng's lectures are humorous and easy to understand, importantly, he will first analyze the real exams, then guide writing sentence by sentence, and provide synonyms, giving examples, suitable for students with average foundation.\n🐾 Shi's seven-step method: Copy English → Translate English to Chinese → Translate Chinese to English → Compare for differences → Specifically memorize and write down mistakes or differences → Memorize and write the entire text without errors → Think about how each sentence can be used to write other topics\n💕Note: ① Don't think that memorizing sentence templates is enough, do more output writing\n② Memorize common sentence patterns, memorize more, write more\n#25 Postgraduate Exam [Topic]#  #Postgraduate Exam [Topic]#  #Postgraduate English [Topic]#  #Three Smaller Subjects [Topic]#  #Tang Jing [Topic]#  #Liu Qi New Question Types [Topic]#",

[Eating Watermelon R]\n[Drinking Milk Tea R] Luckily, I asked the owner of the homestay, and she said that locals also love to go to this shop, and the taste is good. Then——I must go! [Party R]\n\n[Star R] Very friendly to introverted people and friends with choice difficulties\nWhen we arrived at the shop, it was already past 10 PM, and the shop was brightly lit with good business [Fireworks R]. Fortunately, there were a few seats left, and the owner asked us to take a photo of the menu, find a seat first, and order after deciding what to eat. [Like R] It was great for me with choice difficulties! [Like R]\nApart from serving us cutlery and dishes, the waiter gave us ample space, and we felt very comfortable chatting among ourselves. When we called for additional dishes, the waiter was also very quick! [Like R]\n\n[Star R] Yogurt\nThere are many such handmade yogurts in Qinghai, and we have tried many shops. This one tasted pretty good, not too sour, and the sweetness was just right. [Like R] We had some very sour yogurt in Dachaidan. [Laughing and Crying R]\n\n[Star R] Noodle Pieces\nWhen we went, the Firecracker Noodles were sold out [Facepalm R]. We saw many tables ordering this, and a waiter was also eating it, so we asked what it was. Hearing it was noodle pieces, we immediately ordered a bowl to try. Then, it became the NO.1 of the night～[Like R]\n[Star R] Barbecue\nSince it was featured in 'A String of Life', we had to try the barbecue! [Shy R]\nWe ordered some barbecue, but my phone ran out of battery and shut down, so I didn't take any photos! [Crying R]\nThe lamb skewers and grilled lamb tripe were okay, but maybe our expectations were a bit high, so we thought they were just average. 🤔\nThe grilled beef tendon was tough to chew, so be cautious about ordering this! ⚠️\n\n[Star R] Baked Lamb Ribs\nThis should be a local specialty in Qinghai. We saw a table next to us eating a large portion of 'Baked Lamb Ribs' and were worried we couldn't finish it, so we didn't order it that day. 🤔 We asked them about their experience, and they said it was indeed delicious and fragrant, but it got a bit greasy towards the end. ✨\nWe later tried baked lamb ribs in other places in Qinghai, and it was the same feeling. ✨ Initially very fragrant and tasty, but it can get greasy if you eat too much. Because the portions here are really huge with a lot of meat! [Thumbs Up R]\nI think it might also be due to regional differences and eating habits. 🤔 Because that night we saw a table of locals, just two people, finish a portion of baked lamb ribs and even added two pounds of white strip hand-grabbed meat, and they were enjoying it. [Flirty R]\nSo, baked lamb ribs are still worth trying. When in Qinghai, you must try the local specialties!

Hahaha, of course, the most important thing is that it is very late. If you are sleepy, you can go to 24-hour convenience stores like Lawson, FamilyMart, etc., which are open near the subway station. You can buy some food, then have a cup of coffee, and start a night of sightseeing.\n0.30 You can ride a bike around, the streets are very quiet, with a tranquil night atmosphere. You can follow the West Lake, the evening breeze is super cool, some places are a bit dim, so be careful. The blogger likes cycling, so had a good ride around, it's very spacious, super enjoyable.\n1.00 Tired of riding, choose a favorite bench by West Lake to sit down, you can nap, you can stare at West Lake, with the evening breeze, super cool. The gentle evening breeze will comfort every soul by the West Lake. With the wind coming, the lake water hits the shore, play a song you love, it's a super beautiful moment. You suddenly feel quiet, maybe you'll have a good epiphany hahaha. At this time, there will still be all kinds of people by the West Lake. Some are taking photos, some are staying overnight, some are enjoying the scenery, some are jogging at night, an uncle even reminded me to sit by the lake, not to catch a cold... And there are still some street lights on at midnight!\n3.30 At this time, it's the latter half of the night, the temperature will get cooler. Then it's the darkest time, the night is like ink, you can lean on the chair for a nap. You can also wander around, because it will soon be dawn, go to the place you most want to see the moment of dawn.\n5.00 The Xinfeng Snacks on Qingchun Road opens, you can go have breakfast first. The blogger went, because it was very hungry in the latter half of the night hahaha. But after the cold wind, eating steaming hot breakfast is super satisfying, sweeping away the fatigue of staying up late\n5.30 The sky slowly begins to lighten, enjoy the scenery! Whether it's spring, summer, autumn, or winter, you're sure to encounter many beautiful moments! Welcome everyone to share their own views of West Lake. The blogger was unlucky, no sunrise, but the thick fog was also very beautiful. West Lake is like this, with various appearances.\n6.30 You can go to the FamilyMart at Fengqi Road subway to rest for a while, you can charge, the staff are super nice, then take the subway. You can also continue to stay at West Lake, go to West Lake Lingyin Temple, Leifeng Pagoda and other attractions early, start a new day.\n\nThis is a very fun experience, it's even more fun to wait for dawn with good friends, but be careful about personal safety!! #West Lake Scenery Like a Painting[Topic]# #West Lake All Night[Topic]# #Hubin Yintai in77[Topic]# #Hangzhou Travel[Topic]# #Romantic[Topic]# #Sunrise and Sunset[Topic]# #West Lake Photography[Topic]# #Finding That Moment at West Lake[Topic]#",

These inclusions freeze the high-temperature crystalline state during the production of tempered glass and retain it at room temperature. However, this high-temperature crystalline state is not stable at room temperature. During the transformation process, it will be accompanied by a certain volume expansion and enlargement, which leads to the self-destructive phenomenon of the glass.

I saw that I could exchange them for many items, marimekko was all gone, so I ended up exchanging for three Aveda herbal hair care products, two Joyce hand creams, and three Starbucks coupons. I really like that Hong Kong still uses paper vouchers, the printing quality is good, and they have a strong sense of design. In today's digital age, retaining some traditional elements is quite touching. Pacific Place members can even enjoy a free five-day pure yoga experience during their birthday month? Too bad I don't have the time.\nAbout this Starbucks. It doesn't have a storefront, just a small space in the corner of the first floor. It's close to the Lane Crawford home store.\nI saw a male staff member practicing latte art, which touched me. (Delete if infringing)\nAfter ordering, they are happy to provide dine-in cups and utensils for customers. I haven't had this treatment in mainland China for many years. Don't mention hygiene issues. The store has a professional dishwasher. The ambiance of drinking Starbucks, the cup is also one of the elements. The Starbucks in Hong Kong and Macau regions and mainland China are not under the same franchise. The ingredients here are better.

Seeing comparisons of 🍠 with Victoria Harbour and the Bund, I personally feel the Bund is grand, while Victoria Harbour is mature, a beauty accumulated from a century of economic leadership, with skyscrapers against the mountains appearing more three-dimensional. The Ding Ding trams passing through the old roads of Hong Kong Island add a sense of storytelling, and looking back from Sai Ying Pun towards the end of the road is a deep blue super romantic scene.\n1️⃣Eating is indeed expensive; I never did any food research, just ate whatever I encountered, and almost never had a double meal under 100 HKD. Starbucks uses ceramic and glass cups for dine-in, while in mainland China, it's plastic and paper cups. McDonald's is super crowded, with all self-order machines full!\n2️⃣Didn't encounter any of the much-criticized 'ultra-masculine waiters'. The owners and staff at roadside cafes are very polite. Initially, I didn't know about the extra charge for drinks with meals, but the young girl explained it repeatedly.\n🛍️The Chanel salesgirl at Harbour City is beautiful and gentle, gave me a facial after choosing makeup, and even went upstairs to fetch a new bag for me. Bulgari was picked up at a store opposite Harbour City, where the sales staff were very polite, thanking and bidding farewell whether you buy or not. Honestly, I never received such treatment at SKP. Sales staff on both sides taught me to pay with the lowest exchange rate and coupons.\n3️⃣DFS duty-free shops are small, but the beauty brands are quite complete, though I didn't find what I wanted this time. The encountered fresh set was very cost-effective, and the black card girl was very nice and reliable, saving me a lot of money.\n4️⃣Got misled again: 🍠 everyone is hyping up the must-buy list at Mannings, so I specifically went to the Mong Kok plus store, but nobody told me it's not cheap! Didn't dare to buy too much. How good is Jinxiu Tang Dynasty to shop at? I ended up only taking this one back, feeling it's unnecessary to bring souvenir fridge magnets for friends who didn't even ask for it [EmbarrassedR]\n\n😔Regret: Went for the uterus and ovary pendants at the Medical Museum, but by the afternoon of the 5th, everything was gone, and I ended up buying boogers and teeth [LaughCryR] which are quite cute, but still a bit regretful...\n👌🏻Fine, money's all gone, time to go home and pick up bottles to earn more",

        "content": "🌹💦 \"Aroma Diffuser: Add Water or Not?\"\nAn aroma diffuser is a popular household item used to improve air quality and create a comfortable atmosphere. However, opinions vary on whether aroma diffusers should be used with water. Today, we will explore the advantages and disadvantages of water-added and water-free aroma diffusers to help you make a more informed choice.\n💧 Advantages of Water-Added Aroma Diffusers\nWater-added aroma diffusers mix water and essential oils, using ultrasonic vibration or heating technology to convert the mixture into a mist, releasing fragrance.\n• Advantages:\n• More even fragrance diffusion, wide coverage\n• Can increase air humidity, helping to alleviate dryness\n• Suitable for dry seasons or air-conditioned rooms\n• Disadvantages:\n• Requires regular cleaning to prevent scale and bacterial growth\n• May affect the original fragrance of the essential oils\n• Needs power supply\n🚰 Characteristics of Water-Free Aroma Diffusers\nWater-free aroma diffusers typically use a fan or other technology to directly disperse essential oils into the air, without involving water.\n• Advantages:\n• Maintains the original fragrance of the essential oils, undiluted by water\n• Simple maintenance, no worries about scale and bacteria\n• Suitable for long-term continuous use, no need to frequently add water\n• Disadvantages:\n• May not diffuse fragrance as evenly as water-added diffusers\n• May not increase air humidity in dry environments\n• May require more frequent replacement of essential oils\n🌀 Considerations for Suitable Scenarios\nWhen choosing an aroma diffuser, it is important to consider your usage scenario and needs. If you want to increase air humidity in dry winters, a water-added diffuser might be a better choice. If you prioritize the purity of the fragrance and ease of maintenance, a water-free diffuser might be more suitable for you.\n🌿 Safety and Health\nIn terms of safety, water-free diffusers may be safer since they do not involve water, especially in households with children or pets. Additionally, water-free diffusers reduce the risk of scale and bacterial growth.\n🌟 Price and Maintenance\nIn terms of price, water-added and water-free diffusers may differ. Generally, water-added diffusers may be slightly more expensive due to technical complexity. In terms of maintenance, water-free diffusers may be simpler and have lower maintenance costs.\n🌈 Conclusion\nWhether it is a water-added or water-free aroma diffuser, each has its unique advantages and suitable scenarios. Choose the diffuser that best suits you and let it become a helpful assistant in enhancing your quality of life.",

I used a reseller to get a VIP3 fourth row center seat, and coupled with the weekend pricing, it cost me 3000… complete waste of money, not as impressive as expected.\n\n3️⃣Seating choice: First row media reserved seats = VIP3 fourth row; front row has the most interaction; for others, there’s actually not much difference.

        "content": "Chongqing Wanzhou | When memories have a taste\nWanzhou District, under the jurisdiction of Chongqing Municipality, is located at the heart of the Three Gorges Reservoir region, on the eastern edge of the Sichuan Basin. The Yangtze River rushes through from the southwest to the northeast, traversing the entire territory of Wanzhou. To achieve flood control, power generation, and navigation purposes, the Three Gorges Dam project officially started on December 14, 1994. One of the major challenges of this project was to relocate and resettle residents in the reservoir area. This massive undertaking, involving millions of people, took 16 years to complete. Wanzhou, situated at the heart of the Three Gorges Reservoir, played a significant role in this process. A total of 263,000 people were relocated, with nearly half of Wanzhou's old town permanently submerged under the river, making it the largest migration development area in the world.\nIf nostalgia could be expressed, then the people of Wanzhou in their new homeland would certainly say it’s a taste they can never forget.\n\nWanzhou grilled fish originated during the first year of Jingyan in the Southern Song Dynasty. The annual Wanzhou Grilled Fish Festival held every November offers a great opportunity for the reputed local grill masters to showcase their skills. Using freshly caught carp as the main ingredient, the fish is first coated inside and out with seasonings for marination, then clamped between iron grids for charcoal grilling. While the fish skin sizzles and crisps, the inside flesh remains tender and juicy. The seasoning builds upon the essence of Chongqing hotpot, enhanced with a unique formula specific to grilled fish, resulting in flavors such as numbing-spicy, fragrant-spicy, soy-sauce-rich, and pickled-chili varieties.\n\nWanzhou small hotpot does not literally refer to a single-serving hotpot, and it is distinct from the traditional Chongqing hotpots with a central pot on the table. The pot is smaller with a small cup of water placed in the middle, which is key to controlling the heat. The hotpot is first prepared by chefs, who cook the base ingredients like beef, beef tripe, diaphragm meat, and intestines, layering them over cabbage stalks and bean sprouts. At the moment of serving, the Wanzhou small hotpot is already packed to the brim. Over time, new options have been added, such as lightly stewed pig trotters, pork meatballs cooked with tomatoes and daylily, and fresh fish, offering diners more choices beyond traditional spicy flavors.\n\nWanzhou residents call their pocket-sized bamboo steamers “GeGe,” palm-sized and made of tough yet flexible bamboo for easy steaming and convenient serving. A common base layer is made of potatoes, topped with ribs, lamb, beef, intestines, and other meats coated in aromatic spices and rice flour. These are stacked layer by layer inside a large iron pot. As the pot starts boiling, steam rises, creating a mist that resembles endless mountains in the clouds. Accompanied by the usual steamed soup, this serves not only as a simple workday meal but also as a dish to enjoy a variety of flavors with friends.\n\nThe origin of Wanzhou Zhajiang Noodles can be traced back to the late Qing Dynasty. The essence is in the Zhajiang sauce, traditionally made with finely diced pork belly mixed with secret family-made bean paste, slow-cooked over low heat. Two liang (a traditional weight unit) of hand-made alkaline noodles are placed into a deep pot of boiling water, then gently tossed, rolled, and lifted using long bamboo chopsticks. Experienced noodle chefs can perfectly gauge the doneness of the noodles by touch and color alone. The top priority in eating Wanzhou Zhajiang Noodles is to thoroughly mix the sauce, noodles, and Zhajiang. Let the rich broth and meat bits coat the noodles evenly. In one swift bite, the chewy noodles and savory sauce combine to create an irresistible flavor that leaves you craving more.\nAuthor|cytt\nImage 1 Source|Tuchong Creative\nImage 2 Photographer|Yang Manjia\n#China National Geographic Food Geography[Topic]#  #Gourmet[Topic]#  #Wanzhou[Topic]#  #GrilledFish[Topic]#",

So, can it be considered equivalent to 985?\n\nQS top 50 cannot replace 985. What are you talking about? They're even stronger than 985. Do you know how competitive domestic education has become? Zhang Xuefeng is planning his daughter's education path without involving domestic competition. So, where will she go?\n\nFirst, the child will attend a public primary school in China, and then a public middle school. To avoid the high school entrance exam, the child will directly attend an international high school. You should know that studying an A-level course in this international high school will allow the child to go to a university in the UK at the age of 17. With three years of undergraduate study, she will graduate at the age of 20, and a master's program in the UK takes just one year.\n\nThe student will graduate with a master's degree at the age of 21. If the plan goes smoothly, by graduation, she will likely finish her education in the UK's G5 or QS top 30 universities. Do you realize that a 21-year-old master's graduate who pursues a three-year Ph.D. can graduate at the age of 24? How old are domestic Ph.D. graduates?\n\n28 or 29. Do you know about these top-tier schools? A 24-year-old returning Ph.D., especially one that ends up in Suzhou, is absolutely fine. With provincial talent funding, municipal talent funding, and additional funding from universities, you can earn two to three million yuan just by returning. The tuition you spent studying in the UK will be earned back. Can ordinary people replicate this path? Why not? Go to the Greater Bay Area or the Yangtze River Delta, and you'll find this is a common route. #StudyAbroadDestination[Topic]# #StudyAbroadConsultation[Topic]# #StudyAbroadChangesFate[Topic]# #StudyAbroadApplicationGuide[Topic]# #StudyAbroad[Topic]#",

        "content": "【Complaints】Never agreeing to seat change requests again!\nYesterday’s flight to Shenzhen was delayed for a long time due to rain, and we didn’t take off until 2 AM.\n【Process】\n1 My friend and I were originally seated together. As soon as we boarded the plane, the flight attendant came over to ask if we could change seats because there was a child separated from their parents. I told the flight attendant that we were traveling together and asked if there were other seat change options, but she still smiled and asked for our help. In the end, we agreed to change seats.\n2 Once the parent switched over, they immediately swapped seats with the child, allowing the child to lie sideways on them, forming the posture shown in the picture. For the entire 4-hour flight, I was squeezed and kicked by the child’s restless feet. I took off my sleep mask and checked multiple times. The mother noticed too but only casually apologized without correcting the child at all. It was extremely frustrating. Next time, I will firmly refuse similar requests.\n3 Upon disembarking, I discovered that the family was actually traveling as a group of four, with the other three sitting together. They could have just switched the child with another adult to avoid inconveniencing others and still take care of the child. However, they chose to let the mother switch seats instead. I can only interpret this as them knowingly avoiding discomfort by passing it on to others for their 4-hour flight.\n【Flight Attendant’s Role】\nOther than assisting in the seat change, the flight attendants did not address the parent’s behavior for the rest of the flight. When I brought this up during disembarkation, the lead flight attendant responded: 1 During cruising, passengers can choose to unfasten their seat belts and recline, and 2 They can only remind passengers but cannot force them to act in a certain way.\n【Thoughts】\n1 Public spaces are often environments where those with higher moral standards make sacrifices for those with lower ones, and where rule-followers suffer losses to accommodate rule-breakers. Helping others with things like seat changes can result in a major negative experience for oneself. This discourages people from helping others in the future, leaving those who need help to resent the indifference of others.

Despite its youth, Central South is far from \"immature.\" Calling her a \"century-old school\" at the age of 24 is not entirely inaccurate.\n\nHer \"1.0 version\" was born in the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China; her \"2.0 version\" was established in the rejuvenating 1950s; and in 2000, the original Central South University of Technology, Hunan Medical University, and Changsha Railway College merged to form the \"3.0 final version\" of Central South University. The original campuses became the university's main campus, Xiangya Medical School, and Railway Campus, respectively.\nA century of history accumulated, and the strong union of three schools created today's Central South University—Xiangya writes half of China's Western medicine history, the Engineering School continues Tsinghua's spirit, recording 70 years of industrial development in the Republic, with 5 world-class academic schools founded here. The pragmatic and innovative spirit of Hunan is deeply rooted here.\nCentral South, formed by merging three schools, covers an area of over 5,000 acres, with 5 campuses scattered across three districts along both sides of the Xiang River. Central South is indeed vast—its main campus in Yuelu District is near Hunan University and Hunan Normal University, collectively called the \"Yuelu F3\"; from the main campus (North Campus), a small path leads directly to Yuelu Mountain. The Railway Campus in Tianxin District features a \"locomotive\" and is situated on the eastern bank of the Xiang River. Xiangya's old and new campuses, along with its 4 affiliated hospitals, span both Yuelu and Kaifu Districts. Touring Central South might feel like exploring the entire city of Changsha.\nIts Nursing program ranks first nationwide, Metallurgical Engineering first, and Mining Engineering second. Fields such as Materials Science, Engineering Science, and Clinical Medicine rank in the top 1% globally in ESI, with Materials Science in the top 0.1% globally. Though young, Central South excels in engineering and medical disciplines, proving to be as formidable as a \"hidden master.\"\nNot only academically outstanding, the technological advancements on campus are also remarkable—dormitories with card key access implemented years ago, smart dining halls with automated checkout and dishwashing systems, and cafeteria food that's renowned across universities.\nWith over a century of history, Central South remains pragmatic and composed. After 24 years of merging and establishment, Central South enjoys endless possibilities again.

        "content": "At the last moment of life, we are often touched by those tiny but profound details. Among them, the scene of the elderly opening their mouths at the end of their lives has not only struck a chord with countless people but also sparked widespread speculation and discussion. Today, let us uncover the mystery of this phenomenon with a perspective that balances science and warmth.\n[ShyR] Folk warm legend - Unfulfilled wishes: In ancient folklore, it is believed that the elderly open their mouths when dying because they still have unfulfilled wishes in their hearts, as if speaking unspoken words to the world. This attachment and concern convey the depth and warmth of life.\n[WowR] The desire to breathe: Another explanation is that when facing the final challenge of life, breathing becomes extremely difficult. The elderly open their mouths to take in more precious oxygen, which is the most instinctive desire and persistence for life. Scientific rational analysis - The body’s natural deterioration: As life fades, the muscles in the body gradually lose tension, including those controlling the opening and closing of the mouth. This physiological change naturally causes the mouth to open at the end of life, which is the inevitable result of the body’s functional decline.\n[SmileR] Changes in the respiratory system: After brain death or cardiac arrest, respiratory system function rapidly declines, possibly leading to difficulty breathing or even stopping altogether. At this point, the opening of the mouth may be the body’s instinctive attempt to obtain more air, even though it cannot change the outcome of life. The mystery of “death rattle”: With increased secretions in the airway, the dying may experience a phenomenon called “death rattle.” To alleviate this discomfort, they may unconsciously open their mouths to reduce pressure on the airway.\n[PartyR] Respect and farewell - Whether it is folklore or scientific explanation, the phenomenon of the elderly opening their mouths before dying carries the weight and dignity of life.\nAt this moment, we should give them enough respect and care, accompanying them through the last journey of life.

        "content": "Debate Topic: Will artificial intelligence replace humans?\nPro-Side Closing Arguments\nThe inevitability of technological progress: History has shown that technological innovation is the driving force behind social development. From the steam engine to computers, every technological revolution has transformed the way humans work. As the core of the current technological revolution, artificial intelligence, with its advantages in data processing and decision support, signifies that it will replace humans in many fields.\nEconomic cost considerations: In a market economy, enterprises pursue cost efficiency. Artificial intelligence has significant advantages in cost control, reducing labor expenses and enhancing production efficiency, which is key to maintaining competitive strength.\nOvercoming human limitations: Humans have limitations in physical strength, endurance, and precision, while artificial intelligence can overcome these limitations, perform high-risk or repetitive tasks, improve work efficiency, and ensure human safety.\nReplacing emotion and creativity: Although emotion and creativity are unique human advantages, artificial intelligence has already demonstrated creativity in fields such as music and painting. Through machine learning and deep learning, AI can mimic or even create new forms of art.\nEthics and morality programming: Artificial intelligence can be programmed to follow specific ethical principles. With technological advancements, AI's moral judgment capabilities will improve, enabling it to assist humans in making decisions across more domains.\nThe development of adaptability and flexibility: Artificial intelligence's adaptive learning algorithms enable it to adapt to new environments and challenges. With continuous algorithm optimization, AI's flexibility will continue to increase.\nCon-Side Closing Arguments\nHuman emotion and creativity: Human emotion, creativity, and empathy are difficult for artificial intelligence to mimic. These traits are essential in areas such as art, education, and psychological counseling, where AI lacks these capabilities.\nEthical and moral considerations: Artificial intelligence lacks ethical and moral judgment abilities. In decision-making scenarios requiring moral judgment, such as healthcare and law, artificial intelligence cannot replace humans who possess a sense of moral responsibility.\nHuman adaptability and flexibility: Humans can adapt to complex and changing environments and respond flexibly to unknown challenges. Artificial intelligence, however, relies on pre-programmed algorithms and may fail to respond effectively to unanticipated situations.\nThe irreplaceability of emotion and creativity: Although AI can imitate artistic creation, it lacks genuine emotional experience and deep creativity. The core of artistic and creative work lies in human emotion and consciousness.\nThe complexity of ethics and morality: Ethical and moral judgments involve complex situational analyses and value assessments, which current artificial intelligence struggles to achieve. AI decisions may lack necessary humanistic care and moral sensitivity.\nLimitations in adaptability and flexibility: Artificial intelligence's adaptability and flexibility are constrained by its algorithms and data. When faced with extreme or unknown situations, AI may not respond as appropriately as humans. #ArtificialIntelligence[Topic]#  #AIWriting[Topic]#  #AIReplacesHumans[Topic]#  #DebateCompetition[Topic]#  #HumanMachineCollaboration[Topic]#",

The Meaning of Artificial Intelligence\nArtificial intelligence refers to the mechanization of certain human intelligent activities, enabling machines to achieve the capability to accomplish complex goals. Essentially, it is a simulation of the organizational structure and operational mechanisms of the human brain, representing the materialization of human intelligence.\n·\n[Planting Grass R] 2. The Relationship Between Artificial Intelligence and Human Consciousness\nArtificial intelligence is a special manifestation of the intentionality of human consciousness, representing the objectification and realization of human essential power. \nThe emergence of artificial intelligence signifies that human consciousness has developed to the point where parts of conscious activities can separate from the human brain, materializing into the physical motion of machines, thereby extending the functional stages of consciousness organs. \nHowever, even the most powerful and advanced intelligent machines cannot reach the level of human intelligence, truly possess human consciousness, or replace or surpass human intelligence.\n1⃣Human consciousness is a unity of cognition, emotion, and will, whereas artificial intelligence is merely a simulation and extension of human rational intelligence, lacking forms such as emotions, beliefs, and will that constitute human consciousness.\n2⃣Sociality is an inherent essential attribute of human consciousness, which artificial intelligence cannot truly acquire.\n3⃣Human natural language is the material shell of thought and the real form of consciousness, but artificial intelligence cannot fully comprehend the true meaning of natural language.\n4⃣Artificial intelligence can capture the aspects of human consciousness that can be reduced to digital signals, but there are always elements within the human brain that cannot be reduced.\n·\n[Planting Grass R] 3. Guiding and Regulating the Development of Artificial Intelligence\nCurrently, artificial intelligence is still in a developmental phase. It is foreseeable that it will achieve greater advancements in the future. We should observe, think about, and grasp the future development of artificial intelligence and its societal impacts with an open and objective attitude. While fully exploiting the conveniences brought by artificial intelligence, it is also necessary to strengthen the assessment and prevention of risks associated with its misuse, guiding and regulating its development in a direction more beneficial to human survival and progress.\n#ContemporaryReaders[Topic]# #PoliticalExam[Topic]# #Reading[Topic]# #Learning[Topic]# #ArtificialIntelligence[Topic]# #RomanticLifeRecorder[Topic]# #MyPoliticalExam[Topic]# #MarxismTheoryPoliticalExam[Topic]# #BasicPrinciplesOfMarxism[Topic]# #Textbook[Topic]# #Teacher[Topic]#",

Experts have found that many people fail to respond in time during the early stages of formaldehyde poisoning, resulting in continued living in an environment with excessive formaldehyde, which eventually leads to severe illnesses.\nReminder: These 2 symptoms on your body suggest formaldehyde poisoning, do not mistake them for a cold!\nSymptom 1: Throat discomfort, frequent unease\nThe throat is easily affected by formaldehyde because humans constantly breathe, and formaldehyde molecules mixed in the air can easily enter the body. In this situation, the respiratory mucosa can be affected, leading to throat discomfort, frequent coughing, blocked breathing, and so on. Symptom 2: Eye discomfort\nThe eyes are also a sensitive part of the body. If the air contains excessive formaldehyde, the irritation to the conjunctiva is considerable. After being affected by formaldehyde, people's eyes may feel uncomfortable for no apparent reason, presenting symptoms such as itching, redness, or tears. #Formaldehyde[Topic]# #NewHomeFormaldehydeRemoval[Topic]# #BabyFormaldehydePoisoningSymptoms[Topic]#",

        "content": "As a middle school physics teacher, here are my thoughts on tutoring:\n1. Students with good grades who aim to enter key classes in local top high schools generally have a good grasp of basic knowledge. Their school teachers are also competent. Tutoring mainly focuses on expanding thinking, exposing students to different types of questions, and addressing any weak points or question types. Usually, this yields good results.\n2. Students with average grades who want to improve. These students know the basics but don’t fully grasp them. Their ability to apply knowledge comprehensively is weak, making it difficult to improve their scores. They lack physics thinking skills and the ability to analyze and apply knowledge points systematically. It requires a teacher to guide them in gradually developing physics thinking over a long period. Progress is usually slow, and anxious parents might give up when they don't see quick results. Students may also lose confidence and feel disheartened if they don't see improvements in the short term. Additionally, some students tend to forget quickly, learning the current topics while forgetting the previous ones. Teachers need to help these students review and consolidate their learning based on Ebbinghaus's memory curve.\n3. Students with poor grades. There are two types. One type struggles to learn and processes information slowly. Nowadays, very few students are truly 'not smart,' so these students need a slow-paced, patient teaching approach. The other type dislikes their school teacher and refuses to learn because of personal opinions about the teacher. As someone who's been there, I can say that teachers significantly influence students. For example, I started to enjoy physics in school because I thought my physics teacher was cool and interesting (had charisma, balanced rewards and punishments, etc., haha). These students are actually smart but may have delayed their learning for various reasons. They need a compatible teacher to guide them, eliminate their bias, and foster a love for learning. When their grades improve and they gain confidence in class, they naturally won’t resist learning anymore. These students often improve quickly.\nIn my opinion:\n1. Students with decent learning abilities don’t need to study in advance. For instance, there’s a student in my class who relies on extracurricular tutoring, becomes capable of solving problems, and then spends class time talking and disturbing others. They score slightly above average in exams and become complacent.\n2. Students with average learning abilities are encouraged to study in advance. In a class of about 40 students, teachers don’t have the energy to supervise students who perform poorly or don’t understand the material every day. They can only provide individual guidance to underperforming students after exams. Those who ask questions tend to receive more help from teachers, as opposed to quieter students who might not even be recognized by their teachers. For students who lack interest or struggle to understand the material, I hope they can put in the effort privately and attend tutoring sessions. This helps reduce their pressure in class.\nThat’s all for now.

The hotel is about 200 meters from the subway station exit.\nNote: The subway station involves a long walk and does not have escalators, but there is an elevator. If your parents are elderly, you may want to consider this.\nThere are many convenience stores and supermarkets near the station, as well as a McDonald's, making it easy to grab breakfast or snacks in the morning.\nA double room can accommodate three people. You just need to provide the IDs of all three individuals at check-in. However, the bed is only 1.2 meters wide, so parents may need to squeeze a bit.\nDay 1: Jingshan Park and Beihai Park; lunch at Richang Restaurant; watched the flag lowering ceremony.\nBring water: Water in Jingshan Park and Beihai Park is not expensive, with bottled water available for 1.5 RMB at shops and vending machines, so there’s no need to bring a lot. Water at Tiananmen Square is pricey, so bring extra if you tend to get thirsty.\nFood at Richang Restaurant: It is possibly just a short walk from the East Gate of Beihai Park. It’s a Cantonese-style tea restaurant. I bought coupons, but it might be more convenient to scan the QR code and order directly there. The clay pot rice was large in portion, and the chicken wings were quite tasty.\nFlag lowering ceremony: Make sure to book in advance. There are about two security checks, which are quite strict. If you don’t want to wait early for the flag-raising, the flag-lowering ceremony is a good alternative and it’s easier to get a front-row spot. After the ceremony, you can walk through the underpass to the front of Tiananmen Square to see the light and fountain show before heading back.\nDay 2: Great Wall\nTransportation: If possible, opt for high-speed rail. Although buses drop you closer to the entry point of the Great Wall, the journey is quite time-consuming, and I’m not a fan of long rides. Additionally, high-speed train tickets are released the day before, so even though I booked tickets 7 days in advance, I ended up buying new ones to adjust to our itinerary.\nCable Cars: My parents are in their 50s and in good health, so we climbed from Beidaihe (north section 1 to 11) entirely by foot. The cable cars and slides down are at section 8. Sections 9 to 12 are particularly challenging, especially after section 9, and section 10 doesn’t have a descent path. Many people who purchase round-trip cable car tickets end up walking back to section 8 from sections 9 or 11 to catch the cable car.\nIf you just want to experience the Great Wall, consider climbing sections 1-8 and taking the cable car back. Alternatively, if you’re tired midway, use the mid-point descent path or take the cable car to section 8 to challenge sections 8-11, then descend from section 11 for better safety overall.\nBring water: Water is more expensive on the Great Wall, but two bottles per person should suffice. It’s a bit windy atop the wall, and temperatures are slightly lower than in Beijing city.\nDay 3: Forbidden City + Dining + Nighttime at the Bird's Nest and Water Cube\nPlacing the Forbidden City visit on the third day was a bit of a mistake because it was so mesmerizing. After visiting it, my parents lost interest in the Summer Palace (Buddhist Incense Tower) and the Temple of Heaven.\nThe Forbidden City offers free volunteer guides. Around 9:30 AM, we entered the Treasure Hall and encountered a volunteer guide wearing a vest. She showed us around for about an hour and pointed out some highlights of the Forbidden City that are worth seeing.\nDining: Jiumenxuan Roast Duck Restaurant. Recommended on Xiaohongshu. It’s affordable, service is great, and portions are satisfactory.\n#Beijing Travel Guide [Topic]# #Beijing Travel [Topic]# #Traveling with Parents [Topic]#",

        "content": "The correct address of Huawei authorized service center, check here!\nRecently, I found that the battery of the mate30pro I used is not working, and I want to go to Huawei's official after-sales service to replace it with an original battery. However, since I have no previous experience in repairing phones, I walked around the streets and saw many Huawei repair shops, but I didn’t know which one was real and which one was fake. After a long search, I finally found a repair shop that seemed like an official after-sales shop, but I was still deceived. Therefore, I specifically searched for a guide to share with everyone and prevent others from having the same experience.\n1. Choose official inquiry channels: Huawei users can find service stores through official channels before needing repairs. The specific methods include:\n- My Huawei app: Huawei phone users can search for \"My Huawei app\" on the minus-one screen, click on Service > Quick service > In-store repair on the homepage.\n- Huawei Consumer Business Service Official Website: Search for \"Huawei Service Official Website\" on Baidu, enter the homepage, click on Service Store Inquiry > Fill in location information > Search.\n- Huawei Terminal Customer Service Mini Program: Search for \"Huawei Terminal Customer Service\" on WeChat, enter the mini program, click on Store > Fill in location information > Search.\n- Huawei Consumer Hotline: Directly call 950800 to consult customer service.\n2. Pay attention to store signs after arriving at the store:\n- Look at the signboard: The official service store signboard prominently features the Huawei logo and clearly states \"Authorized Service Center\" and \"Hotline 950800\".\n- Look at the authorization plaque: The store has an official service authorization plaque, which can be scanned for the QR code on the plaque or verified through the service official website using the authorization code.\n3. Confirm repair credentials: After the repair is completed, the official service store will provide formal repair credentials, such as a repair report and invoice.\nCompared with counterfeit stores, Huawei official service stores excel in repair professionalism, spare parts reliability, cost transparency, and privacy security. Huawei official services have a professional technical team, with online sites 100% certified by COPC (the highest level of industry certification) and more than 80% of technical support experts holding national-level professional certifications. All spare parts are original parts; repair prices are standard and transparently unified; users will be reminded to back up their data before repair and assisted in enabling \"Repair Mode\" to protect user privacy and security. Moreover, Huawei Services has launched many special services, such as \"Flat-rate Battery Replacement,\" \"Memory Upgrade,\" \"Outer Glass Repair for Screens,\" \"Discounted Screens,\" and more.\nIf you encounter suspicious Huawei after-sales stores, you can call Huawei's customer service hotline 950800 to verify or report it to protect your legitimate rights and interests.",

        "content": "Advise you to carefully consider before enrolling in the Open University of China; there are tricks involved!!\n✨Dear friends, today I will give you a detailed explanation of the Open University of China.\n💡1. What is the Open University of China?\nThe former Central Radio and Television University is now renamed the Open University of China. It belongs to open online remote education, is directly under the Ministry of Education, and is a key university of the nation.\n🌟2. What are its advantages? (Compared to other forms of education)\n🎈1. Enrollment happens in two seasons, spring and autumn. Spring enrollment starts in March, and autumn enrollment in September. Spring batch appears on the academic record network around April, and autumn batch around October.\n🎈2. No entrance exams are required; registering equals enrollment, so there’s no exam stress at all.\n🎈3. No regional restrictions; students across the nation (excluding Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan) can enroll.\n🎈4. Short academic period, quick graduation. Both the associate degree and bachelor’s programs take 2.5 years, and you can graduate smoothly in this time. The format is highly flexible.\n🎈5. Fully online learning, convenient and worry-free.\n💰3. How much is the tuition, and why does it vary?\nThe tuition fee for an associate degree at the Open University of China is usually between 7500 and 8000, while a bachelor’s degree is between 9500 and 10000. Why is it a range? Because the operating costs of different learning centers vary. In cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen, costs are higher, so tuition is also higher. Additionally, some recruitment agents might charge extra fees.\n🙅‍♀️4. Is full delegation reliable?\nThe Open University of China provides a learning account and password. When students don’t have time to learn, the study center may have administrative staff help out or manage learning, but full delegation is unreliable. If policies change or unforeseen events occur, it can create significant trouble and may even constitute fraud.\n❌5. Can junior high school graduates enroll in associate degree programs?\nNo. To enroll in the Open University of China’s associate degree program, you must be at least 17 years old and have the equivalent of a high school diploma. Do not use fake certificates as the risk is very high. If verified, your academic record will be revoked, and even if you graduate, your diploma can be taken back, disqualifying you from passing background checks. Junior high school graduates can first enroll in a vocational secondary school to address the prerequisite qualification issue.\n🚫7. What are the pitfalls of enrolling? (Very important)\n🎯1. Full delegation is unreliable; don’t just wait for graduation.\n🎯2. Promises of graduating in two years or one and a half years are false advertisements; all programs take two and a half years.\n🎯3. Be cautious of paying extra tuition; avoid intermediary agents of agents.\n🎯4. Do not falsify prerequisite qualifications; the consequences are severe.\n🎯5. Never pay tuition in a lump sum, or you’ll lose control.\n🎯6. Verify the enrollment agency’s business license and student details carefully.\nDear friends, when enrolling in the Open University of China, make sure to be cautious. Feel free to leave your questions anytime for discussion, and I’ll help you navigate the journey of improving your education smoothly. 💖\n#OpenUniversity[Topic]# #OpenUniversityofChina[Topic]# #CollegeUpgrading[Topic]# #AdultEducation[Topic]# #CorrespondenceUndergraduate[Topic]# #OpenUniversityEducation[Topic]#",

Although cockroaches are social insects, discovering just one cockroach does not confirm it is reproducing in large numbers at home. Here is a detailed analysis of this issue:\n[SideEyeR] Cockroach living habits\n1. Sociability: Cockroaches indeed have a social habit, and they release \"aggregation pheromones\" to attract others to gather.\n2. Strong reproductive ability: Cockroaches have a robust reproductive ability, with a single female cockroach capable of producing multiple egg cases, each hatching many nymphs.\n3. Photophobic nature: Cockroaches prefer dark and damp environments, hiding in crevices or corners during the day and becoming active at night.\n[SmileR] Possible situations when finding one cockroach\n1. Accidental entry: The cockroach may have entered the house accidentally through gaps in windows or doors and temporarily hid in a corner.\n2. Early reproduction stage: If there is indeed a reproduction situation, this cockroach might be from the early stage, but it does not necessarily mean there is already a nest.\n3. Isolated individual: This cockroach could also be an isolated individual not forming a group with others.\n[PartyR] How to determine if there is a cockroach nest at home\n1. Observe habits: Night is the active time for cockroaches, so carefully observe if there are signs of frequent cockroach activity at home.\n2. Inspect environment: Cockroaches like damp and cluttered areas, so check places like the kitchen and bathroom for droppings, shed skins, or egg cases.\n3. Professional inspection: If uncertain about the presence of a nest, seek professional pest control services for inspection and confirmation.\n[SelfieR] Preventive measures\n1. Maintain cleanliness: Regularly clean the living environment, especially damp and dark areas, to reduce food sources and breeding grounds for cockroaches.\n2. Seal gaps: Check and seal gaps connected to the outside to prevent cockroaches and other pests from entering.\n3. Use insecticides: When necessary, use professional insecticides for spraying or placing baits to kill cockroaches. Additionally, it is recommended to use Jiada insecticide, which can kill various cockroach pests by direct spraying. Spray in corners, wall crevices, and areas where cockroaches frequent. It has no irritating smell, is harmless to humans and pets. Some types of cockroaches may die instantly after being sprayed, some may have a delayed death process, and others may return to the nest, thereby transmitting the poison to other cockroaches, leading to a chain killing effect.\n[EatingMelonR] In conclusion, finding one cockroach does not necessarily mean there is a nest at home.

Although they usually live in damp environments, they sometimes invade our homes. The presence of slugs is not only uncomfortable but can also damage the plants in the home. So, how can we eradicate slugs at home?\n\n[Big Laugh R]1. Keep the environment dry\n\nSlugs like humid environments, so keeping the home environment dry is key to preventing and eliminating them. Repair any leaks in the house and ensure that there are no places with stagnant water. Additionally, regularly open windows for ventilation, increase indoor light exposure, and lower indoor humidity, which will make it difficult for slugs to survive.\n\n[Wow R]2. Clean up clutter\n\nSlugs often hide in clutter, trash, or fallen leaves. Regularly cleaning up such items in your home can reduce their hiding places. At the same time, ensure that the outdoor environment, such as gardens and balconies, is also kept tidy.\n\n[Selfie R]3. Use pesticides\n\nUse insect repellents or pesticides for prevention and control. It is recommended to use Crawl-Up Insecticide Powder, which is very effective. After sprinkling Crawl-Up powder in the main bedroom, secondary bedroom, and living room, focus on applying it to dark, damp places suitable for slug survival, such as bathroom and study room door and window tracks and other nooks and crannies. After contact with the drug, slugs will slowly die of poisoning.\n\n[Thumbs Up R]4. Make traps\n\nYou can use the slugs' preference for damp and sweet foods to create traps. For example, place some moist soil or newspaper in a shallow container, along with some fruit slices or honey. Slugs will be attracted to this food and crawl into the container, after which you can dispose of them.\n\n[Doge]5.

Alcohol introduces a distinctive wine fragrance, forming the unique sweet and wine-infused flavor with a perfect balance of sweetness and saltiness.\n2️⃣Rich and aromatic cured flavor\nCantonese-style cured sausage has a strong cured aroma due to the use of ingredients like white liquor and soy sauce during preparation. White liquor not only removes odor and enhances flavor but also produces unique aromatic hydrocarbons during fermentation, giving the sausage its characteristic wine aroma. Soy sauce adds a distinct umami flavor.\n3️⃣Tender meat texture\nThe sausage uses high-quality selected pork leg meat, retaining the tender texture of meat through traditional processing techniques involving over ten steps. The lean meat is firm, while the fatty meat, dried at low temperatures, has a translucent appearance. Each bite is juicy, perfectly balanced, not overly greasy, and not too dry.\n[ShyR] Our family consumes the sausage we produce. It has a 30:70 fat-to-lean ratio, ensuring that it is neither dry nor greasy, allowing every bite to leave a lasting impression. 🍖 Whether steamed, stir-fried, or cooked, it's incredibly delicious [ThumbsupR]. If you're a cured sausage enthusiast, you can’t miss this Guangdong-style sausage!

We grabbed them enthusiastically, spotting bread crabs and sea crabs, as shown in Picture 2, dozens of them in all sizes. At night, we planned to feast, washed them thoroughly, and prepared to steam them (Picture 1). But after checking on Baidu, we found out this isn’t a bread crab but a Neoliomera pubescens, which is highly toxic and full of tetrodotoxin.

For the first two or three days of using the activated carbon packs, the air felt noticeably fresher, but after that, it wasn't as obvious.\n\nAfter a few months of use, I thought it might be time to replace the activated carbon packs, so I ordered new ones and threw the old ones away. When the new ones arrived, I didn't unpack them and just left them there, partly because I was lazy and partly because I forgot about them. Over the past week or so, I started feeling like I had a mild cold, with sagging eyelids, and I wondered if it was due to eating something unclean or some illness. I even thought about going to the hospital for a checkup. I cleaned up the extra items in my room, trying to see if something was emitting an odor. The room had a faint smell, whether it was from the ceiling or the wall paint, and opening the windows only helped a little.\n\nThen today, I suddenly remembered the new activated carbon packs. I thought I'd give them a try. About 20 minutes later, my sagging left eyelid felt better, and I felt more energetic. After about an hour, I felt much more spirited and full of energy, even wanting to exercise. For the past 10-plus days, I had felt uncomfortable without knowing why, which was quite worrying. Now that I found the cause, I finally felt relieved.\n\nI used to not believe that activated carbon could remove formaldehyde or harmful odors, thinking ventilation was key. But since the bedroom can't always stay open—windows have to be closed for sleeping or using air conditioning—the activated carbon packs played a significant role in such scenarios. This experience really made me realize they are indeed effective. Poor interior decorations can seriously affect health, even if you can't notice any obvious odor. Unfortunately, my current lease hasn't ended yet. Next time I rent, I will pay more attention to this, avoiding poorly maintained apartments. Landlords typically don't care about your health.\n\nThis time, I didn’t buy the expensive branded activated carbon packs worth hundreds. I just bought a 20-yuan pack with high sales volume online, and the results were equally good. It's not surprising since activated carbon packs are not high-tech products. I found that placing them on mosquito nets works remarkably well as it increases the contact area with the air.

Many friends asked me where to watch it, so I'm sharing here! Recommendations from locals to avoid bad experiences!\n😝Time😝: Fireworks are usually set off at 8:30 PM\n📍Recommended locations📍\n📸1. Sky Theater\nThe top choice is, of course, the Sky Theater—the official main venue for fireworks. There will also be performances on-site, and the music is the clearest here. If you want to experience fireworks along with a concert, this is the place to be. But, of course, tickets are required, and for major events, prices often range from 598 to 998 per person.\n💰Cost: Major events 598+\n🚧Road closure time: None\n⚠Notes: Make sure to buy tickets in advance! Buy tickets in advance! Buy tickets in advance!\n📸2. Cijin Beach\nThis is the fireworks launch site, so in terms of distance, Cijin Beach is the closest! You can experience the stunning impact of fireworks here, and it's even better for photography compared to event venues. My courtyard is here too!\n💰Cost: Regular days 20/person, peak periods 50-100\n🚧Road closure time: 4:30 PM, traffic jams during peak periods! Traffic jams! Traffic jams! It's recommended to come early!\n⚠Notes: For major events, book in advance, or there won't be any spots left. Also, Cijin Beach's mountaintop starry campground offers meals. My family provides meals, while it seems others don't. My sister is an amazing cook! (Meals need to be reserved in advance). Additionally, during summer, at a distance of 600 meters from the launch site, paddleboards are available to enjoy fireworks on the water. Summer visitors should check it out!\n📸3. Surroundings of Sky Theater\nLocated on the streets directly behind the Sky Theater, such as Jincheng Avenue and Shuijia Road, these are also excellent spots. Many areas here are free, but these locations lack services and seating. The viewing spots might be slightly distant.\n💰Cost: None\n⚠Notes: These spots are quite far, so if you can go to location 1 or 2, it's better not to come here since there will be a lot of people, haha.\n⭕Tips: 1️⃣ Roads will be closed for fireworks, so plan ahead! 2️⃣ Fireworks are not restricted in Liuyang, so you can buy some and play by the river! 3️⃣ For those driving, consider a two-day trip and explore the surrounding areas—it's great fun.\n#EscapeCityNoise [Topic]# #LiuyangFireworksGuide [Topic]# #LiuyangFoodExploration [Topic]# #ChangshaSuburbanTrip [Topic]# #OldTanziRelaxedLife #LiuyangFireworks [Topic]#",

        "content": "Taobao Rights Protection succeeded, refunded after 15 days!\nHope more and more people succeed in protecting their rights and dare to defend their interests!!!\nMy experience offers some inspiration to everyone:\nAt the end of 2023, I bought a gold ring, only to find it had turned black in July 2024. I had never worn it during that time. When contacting the seller, they had closed their store and disappeared. Thus, I reached out to Taobao customer service for rights protection. Here's a simplified account of what happened:\n\n1️⃣ The seller ran off and had insufficient deposit funds. Taobao will say they’ll urge the seller to replenish their deposit (this can take 30–90 days). At this point, DO NOT WAIT!! Directly disagree! Call the top-right customer service hotline to connect with a live customer representative and start scolding them. I don't need to teach you how to scold. Also, express your reasonable demand: A full refund!!\n2️⃣ Taobao will assign a customer service representative to handle your case. The first representative I encountered told me that Taobao would not issue a full refund but could offer a small compensation fee. At this point, you need to scold them while referencing Taobao’s policies or Articles 44 and 45 of the Consumer Rights Protection Law, which stipulate that when the seller runs off, Taobao has the responsibility to advance payments.\nNote: When the seller disappears, don’t bother tracking them down—they’re untraceable. Firmly hold Taobao accountable and put the blame on them.\n3️⃣ If the first representative doesn’t help you, doesn’t offer a full refund, call customer service and complain about them! (Such complaints have a major impact on them! You must file complaints.) Then Taobao will assign you a second representative. Remain firm in your stance—demand a full refund and have them deal with it. If they don’t refund you fully, keep complaining! Generally, after dealing with 2–3 representatives, they will resolve your issue.\n4️⃣ Regarding complaints against Taobao: I don’t recommend using 12315 or Black Cat Complaints. 12315 doesn’t protect consumer rights, while Black Cat Complaints are very slow—by the time I got my refund, they still hadn’t resolved anything. My recommendation: go to Hangzhou Internet Court and sue Taobao. While doing this, inform Taobao’s customer service that you’ve already filed a lawsuit to put pressure on them!\n5️⃣ Notes: First, never wait for the so-called 30-day deposit replenishment. You must call customer service to scold them every day and file complaints after scolding!! Don’t stop scolding until the matter is resolved! Secondly, if you want a full refund, you need to be reasonable and justified in your argument. No matter how much compensation or goodwill gestures the representative offers, refuse them!!! Lastly, ensure the Alipay account and bank card linked to your Taobao account are all pre-confirmed in advance to avoid any issues with the refund later.\n\n#Taobao[topic]##TaobaoComplaints[topic]##WhatToDoAboutFakeGoodsOnTaobao[topic]##HowToAvoidGettingCheatedOnTaobao[topic]##DefendingAgainstCounterfeitGoodsOnTaobao[topic]##ReportingIgnoredTaobaoComplaints[topic]#",

        "content": "What should you do if your pet fractures a bone? Internal fixation or external fixation?\nRegarding whether to choose internal fixation or external fixation for a pet's fracture:\n1. Risks of each option that pet owners should be aware of:\nExternal fixation: ① Risks of malunion, where bone malunion may lead to uneven leg lengths. ② Generally used as a conservative treatment option for cases without open wounds. Of course, there are many cases where pets recover with external fixation and regain normal limb function, but this depends on the daily care provided by the owner and the pet's cooperation.\nInternal fixation: ① Achieves the best bone healing results. ② Requires two surgeries (one to set the bone with a bracket and another to remove the bracket). ③ Might face issues similar to the ones I encountered. ④ Risks of wound infection and bone necrosis.\n2. Choosing the right hospital requires caution:\nThis is one of the main reasons I wrote this article. I hope my sharing can help more pet owners. When a pet accidentally fractures a bone, do not panic. In fact, cats' bones grow five times faster than humans', so conservative treatments may be safer than choosing the wrong hospital.\nThrough the unexpected incident with my cat, and conversations with many other pet owners, I learned this is a common issue domestically. This makes it even more important for pet owners to carefully evaluate their options to ensure their pet receives proper care.\nMy experiences with two failed surgeries have taught me a lot: the first surgery involved anesthesia induction via breathing, leading to brain hypoxia and brain damage during the rescue process. After bringing the cat home, I found it had varying degrees of impairments in intelligence, vision (almost blind), hearing, and smell, making it unable to care for itself.\nThe second surgery used local anesthesia, but resulted in malunion — the paw is misaligned, and the cat struggles and cries out loudly whenever touched.",

        "query": "Can feline distemper be transmitted to other cats?",
        "content": "Feline distemper carrier? Passed it\nThe kitten has been at home for 2 months, and finally got its vaccine yesterday. The scary feline distemper carrier that has been haunting my mind is finally far away from me!! [RoseR][RoseR]\n\n[ShyR] My home is a standard multi-pet household. When the kitten was brought home, it was just over one month old and had just learned to eat food. When it was brought home, the original pet residents did not react well. (Isolation is a must in multi-pet households.) After three days of home isolation to prevent stress, we did a new pet health check. The vet said it was a feline distemper carrier!!! I was stunned because, even though isolation was in place, the big cat and the kitten were in monitored contact daily. They had only started getting along these few days. My first thought was whether it would affect my big cat (Dabao). The vet just said to observe as it might not necessarily be contagious and recommended I boost the big cat's vaccine. Increased nutrition, stress prevention, and cold prevention were suggested for the kitten.\n\n[EmbarrassedR] After returning home, I immediately looked up information and consulted sisters who had experienced similar situations. Here are the conclusions (for reference only; consult a vet for specifics): \n1. Feline distemper is about whether it manifests or not, and whether it does depends on the kitten's constitution. Being a carrier just means possessing the virus capable of causing it. \n2. New kittens must be isolated. For nursing kittens, contracting feline distemper usually becomes critical within days. Early on, observing their eating and stooling habits can show if they are healthy. (Do not leave mentally and physically healthy kittens in the hospital; it can cause stress). The issue resolves after the vaccine course is completed.\n\n[WowR] Our kitten came from a home where the seller kept dogs, so the kitten has a relatively bold demeanor and was overall in great condition. After arriving at the new home, it only experienced soft stools but no diarrhea (the advantage of being a local cat!). So, I just needed to focus on keeping it warm and stress-free.\n\n[BlowingKissR] My subsequent management wasn't particularly reference-worthy. The big cat has a great temperament and would be gentle with the kitten during play. That time coincided with an especially cold period in Hunan. They would cuddle together for warmth. Usually, the big cat sleeps with me, but during that time, it would voluntarily curl up with the kitten. Overall, the big cat cared for the kitten, nicknamed Pangpang, even better than I did [LaughCryR]. I made clothes for Pangpang from my wool socks so that it would smell like me. Vaccines for the big cat were updated. After another three days, they were cohabitating. (The nutritional products I bought, besides the nutritional paste, were barely touched by the cats. It seems their constitution is the key factor.) Up till now 👀, it's been over a month. They get along well, the first vaccine is done, and this feels like step one of victory.

It was developed by Western missionaries in 1886. The mountain is over 800 meters high, and the highest summer temperature does not exceed 30°C, making it a perfect summer resort.\nGuling features many foreign-style buildings and has a rich history.\nTo get to Guling, you can take Metro Line 2 to Gushan Station and then take a shuttle bus to the Tourist Center (15 yuan, one bus per hour, leaving on the hour, with a 30-minute ride). Alternatively, you can take a taxi directly. I chose to take a taxi to Changtianxi Flower Field, with a shared ride costing 30 yuan. The altitude there is already quite high, nearly the mountain's peak.\nToday the weather was cloudy with sudden rain, which affected the trip significantly.\nAdmission to Guling's attractions is free. There are four main sightseeing routes, all converging at the Tourist Center (Silver Cedar King Park).\n1. Changtianxi Flower Creek Valley Trail: This is the most iconic natural scenic area of Guling. It's beautiful in spring when the flowers bloom, and there is a checkpoint at Keping Reservoir. However, due to water flooding the steps after heavy rain, I decided not to proceed, which was a bit regrettable.\n2. Guling Ancient Street Route: Starting from Changtianxi, the route passes through Yingyue Lake, Old Street Post Office, Guling Old Post Office, Kodak Photo Shop, Cosmopolitan Charitable Society (with extensive exhibits), Foreigner Swimming Pool, and Li Shijia Villa (Dream Bookstore, a must-see spot) and other historical buildings, ending at the Tourist Center. This route is not long, well-marked, and is a great way to learn about Guling's history of international exchange.\n3. Starting from the Tourist Center, this route goes through the Silver Cedar King Park (Fujian's highest-altitude park, with a 1,300-year-old silver cedar tree), Yixia Villa, Guling Church, Gardener Memorial Hall, and Fugui Villa, etc., making it a cultural route.\n4. After completing Route 3, you can take the Zhuli Trail back to Silver Cedar King Park. However, due to concerns about the rain, I didn't take this route. It's considered a natural scenic route, suitable for sunny weather.\nAfter visiting Guling, if you want to continue to the adjacent Gushan, the normal procedure is to return to the Tourist Center and take a bus to the Gushan bus station. However, as I didn't find a direct shuttle bus, I impulsively decided to walk along the road from Guling to Gushan, which was exhausting. Don't learn from me.\nGuling does have some accommodations, but they're generally not cheap. If you're considering a self-driving vacation, it might be worth it, but for ordinary tourists, it's better to skip that.\nFinally, I would like to ask when the direct shuttle bus from Guling Tourist Center to the top of Gushan will resume?\n\n#Fuzhou[Topic]# #FuzhouCheckIn[Topic]# #Guling[Topic]# #PhotoInGuling[Topic]# #GulingVilla[Topic]# #PlayInGuling[Topic]# #GulingGuide[Topic]# #FuzhouGuling[Topic]#",

        "query": "Does China Unicom's King Card offer free data for Xiaohongshu?",
        "content": "The King Card is really annoying. Quit sooner, save yourself trouble sooner❗️❗\nChina Unicom’s King Card! I’m speechless! If you’re considering getting this card, you might want to read my notes first and think carefully.\nI was attracted to the King Card due to its promotional offers. But later, I found that the data became less and less sufficient, frequently exceeding limits. Sometimes, my daily charges were even tens of yuan.\nAfter a day of hard work earning just 200 yuan, spending half of it on this really hurts.\nLater, I tried other major cards and realized that the King Card is just a pitfall.\nThey say it includes 40GB of data, but it's actually the total volume. Directed traffic alone takes up 30GB, which is useless to me.\nAs for “free data,” it’s not free at all. Using Xiaohongshu’s private messages or posting content still incurs charges.\nHere are the pitfalls of the King Card summarized by MuMu Senior 🕳:\n1⃣ When using software with designated directed data, their directed data package only reduces a small portion. The rest is considered out-of-package data, meaning you need to pay extra. Adding the initial 29 yuan per month, it’s sure to cost more than that 💸\n(For example: playing a game used 0.12GB. The directed data package deducts 0.02GB, but the remaining 0.10GB counts as out-of-package data.)\n2⃣ Playing games becomes extremely laggy 🎮. It’s okay for solo bot matches, but during ranked games or team battles, there’s a lag every two minutes with a 460 warning! The gaming experience is terrible and very frustrating! 😱\n3⃣ After applying for the King Card, you can only switch to other King Card packages 🚫. I’m using the lowest tier of 29 yuan/month, meaning that changes can only upgrade to more expensive options. You cannot switch to non-King Card packages 😭. This forces me to use this poor card with laggy data and so-called directed packages that secretly charge extra fees for months!!\n4⃣ Online customer service is unhelpful 💬. They fail to address key issues, and phone hotlines are often busy. Problems are hard to resolve 😭\n-\nWhat other data cards can replace the King Card? MuMu has researched some legitimate internal operator data cards with no hidden tricks 🈚 and recommends them to everyone. Hope this helps you get off this scam easily. If you’re still hesitant, I suggest directly trying these options!\n-\nTelecom Summer Card\nMonthly fee: 29R\nData: 105GB for general use + 30GB directed\nCalls: 100 minutes\nPromotional period: Long-term valid, no price raise for 20 years!\nAdvantages: Free first-month rent, selectable number, self-activation without contract\n-\nTelecom Winter Plum Card\nMonthly fee: 19R\nData: 105GB for general use + 30GB directed\nCalls: 0.1R/minute\nPromotional period: 19R per month for 2 years\nAdvantages: Free first-month rent, no contract\n-\nUnicom Green Plum Card\nMonthly fee: 19R (for six months, later 39R)\nData: 204GB all-purpose\nCalls: 100 minutes\nPromotional period: Long-term valid, nationwide use\nAdvantages: Massive data, long-term packages\n-\nThese data cards are free to apply for and come with free shipping to your home.\nLimited stock, so if you need one, act quickly~ 😉 For more details, follow me or enter the code 666🎈\n#RecorderofRomanticLife[Topic]# #DataCard[Topic]# #ChinaUnicomKingCard[Topic]# #PhoneTips[Topic]# #Techniques[Topic]# #AvoidPitfallsWithDataCards[Topic]# #TelecomDataCard[Topic]# #MobileDataCard[Topic]# #UnicomDataCard[Topic]# #SavingTips[Topic]#",

Learn about the development history of calculation tools.\nCourseware displays the textbook P23 theme image.\nTeacher: The tools we use today have continuously evolved based on the wisdom of our ancestors. Let's journey back over two thousand years and experience the development process of calculation tools together!\n(1) Over two thousand years ago, ancient Chinese people used counting rods for calculation. These rods were small sticks of the same length and thickness, usually 13-14 cm long and 0.2-0.3 cm in diameter, often made of bamboo, but also wood, animal bone, ivory, metals, etc. Around 270 rods formed a bundle, carried in a cloth bag tied to the waist for portability. When counting, they were laid out on tables, kangs, or the ground for use. Despite their simplicity, these rods played a significant role in the history of Chinese mathematics, aiding the development and sustained progress of ancient Chinese mathematical achievements.\n(2) With societal advancements, simplifying calculations and increasing speed became urgent. The counting rods were thus reformed, and over a thousand years ago, Chinese people invented a new tool - the abacus. The abacus, a traditional Chinese calculation tool, was widely used in production and daily life.\n(3) In the early 17th century, the British invented the slide rule. By the mid-17th century, Europeans invented mechanical calculators.\n(4) In the 1940s, Americans invented the world's first electronic computer. It was a giant machine occupying 170 square meters, weighing 30 tons, and capable of 5,000 calculations per second.\n#UnderstandingCalculationTools[Topic]# #UnderstandingLargeNumbers[Topic]# #People'sEducationGrade4MathCourseware[Topic]# #People'sEducationGrade4MathLessonPlans[Topic]# #Grade4FirstSemesterMathSummerPreview[Topic]# #ElementaryMathTeacherQualificationInterview[Topic]# #NewCurriculumElementaryMathTeacherPreparation[Topic]#",

It is usually issued in five copies. The first copy is the stub kept in the student file, and another copy is held by the student themselves, so make sure to keep that copy safe!\n\n🚩1. File a complaint with the relevant department.\n\n✔️(1) Contract refunds and other disputes: File a complaint with 12345 or 12315;\n\n✔️(2) Driving school qualification issues: File a complaint with 12328. During the complaint process, keep all records of communication with the driving school, such as informing the coach that you have reported their actions to the 12328 platform (be sure to confirm the coach's name and the full name of the driving school);\n\n✔️(3) File a complaint with 12123 (Traffic Management Bureau): Any issues can be submitted in writing to the municipal office. If the district bureau does not handle it, escalate to the city bureau for feedback. It is very efficient.\n\n➡️① 12328\nDriving schools are under the jurisdiction of 12328. At every step of the complaint process, maintain all communication records, such as telling the coach, \"I have reported you and the driving school's actions to the 12328 platform,\" (make sure to confirm the coach's name and the full name of the driving school), and exert pressure by saying, \"If you don't agree to negotiate the refund with me properly, the relevant departments will handle it.\"\n\n➡️② National Petition Bureau\nSubmit your complaint to the Petition Bureau. Please note! Driving school refunds fall under the education category, so select the proper category. Once your complaint is accepted, the processing speed is extremely fast and efficient.

        "content": "How much does it cost to own a Porsche 911 for a year?\n1. Insurance\nAlthough different car owners may purchase different types of insurance, for a million-level sports car like the Porsche 911, the annual insurance cost is certainly not cheap. For the entry-level model, buying full insurance requires a cost of 40,000-50,000 yuan. Even after excluding some less important insurance types, it still costs around 30,000 yuan per year.\n2. Maintenance cost\nThe routine maintenance of a Porsche 911 includes oil changes, oil filter replacements, and air filter replacements. Although the cost of these parts is not high, Porsche's labor costs are relatively expensive. Generally, one maintenance costs about 2,000 yuan. If maintenance is done every 10,000 kilometers or half a year, then yearly maintenance alone will cost about 4,000 yuan.\n3. Fuel cost\nThe entry-level Porsche 911 is equipped with a 3.0T 6-cylinder engine, which delivers a maximum horsepower of 385. With such strong performance, the actual fuel consumption of the car is about 17 liters per 100 kilometers. Assuming the car drives 20,000 kilometers a year and the current price of 98-octane fuel in Guangdong Province is 8.67 yuan/L, the annual fuel cost is 29,478 yuan.\n4. Parking and car wash fees\nFamilies who can afford a million-level sports car likely have fixed parking spaces at home. However, company parking fees or parking fees incurred during outings and shopping trips also add up to a significant expense. Additionally, to maintain the car's attractive appearance, regular car washes are essential. The annual cost of parking and car washing is approximately 2,000 yuan.\nPorsche 911 annual car usage cost summary:\nAdding up the insurance, maintenance, fuel, parking, and car wash expenses, the total annual cost is 65,478 yuan. Of course, these are just the idealized costs. In real life, you might also have to bear expenses for car beautification, fines for violations, repairs due to scratches or collisions, wear and tear from track usage, and other miscellaneous costs. Realistically, at least 100,000 yuan is estimated annually for car upkeep. #Dongguan[Topic]##Porsche[Topic]# #Porsche[Topic]# 911",

I also posted pictures above~ You can head to the designated stops according to your schedule to wait. Tickets can be purchased in advance or onboard from the bus attendant. However, during peak season, on-site seats might be limited, so it's recommended to book tickets in advance.\n🤗 Regarding ticket booking, you can search for Three Gorges Tourism Direct Bus in the mini-program to purchase tickets.\nPs: Many people asked why the ticket for the Three Gorges Family Direct Bus used to cost 15 yuan.

        "content": "The Function and Principle of Kjeldahl Nitrogen Analyzer\nKjeldahl nitrogen analyzer, also known as nitrogen analyzer, protein analyzer, crude protein analyzer, is a device that uses the Kjeldahl method to measure nitrogen content in samples, thereby calculating protein content.\n\nWorking Principle of Kjeldahl Nitrogen Analyzer\n\nPlace the pretreated sample in the combustion chamber of the nitrogen analyzer, and introduce high-purity oxygen simultaneously. The sample reacts with oxygen in a high-temperature environment, producing gas.\n\nThe generated gas passes through the solution tube, allowing it to come into contact with a certain amount of solution, which absorbs carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases.\n\nPlace the solution tube in a container and measure the change in gas volume using the inversion method. The volume of nitrogen gas produced in the oxygen reaction is proportional to the nitrogen content in the sample.\n\nBy measuring the volume of nitrogen gas and calibrating it, the nitrogen content can be determined.\n\nFeatures of Kjeldahl Nitrogen Analyzer\n\n1. Equipped with a microcomputer control system, offering both automatic and manual modes.\n\n2. Capable of performing operations such as water addition, water level control, dilution, acid addition, alkali addition, and distillation with one click.\n\n3. Allows up to 999 operation processes to be set, with each process supporting up to 8 independent control phases.\n\n4. Features four independent inlet micro pumps with high flow precision. The interior uses imported silicone tubing for a longer service life.\n\n5. Comes with a 5.5-inch LCD screen, supports Chinese and English switchable, and features touchkey operation.\n\n6. Includes multiple safety modules like water shortage alarm, fault alarm, and current safety alarm.\n\n7. The device casing is made of special spray-coated steel, and the safety door is made of corrosion-resistant transparent material, making it convenient for staff to observe the internal operation of the equipment.\n\n8. Suitable for various water sources.\n\nMaintenance and Care of Kjeldahl Nitrogen Analyzer\n\n1. The equipment should be placed in a ventilated, dry, and well-cooled environment.\n\n2. If liquids accumulate in the front container of the equipment, they should be cleaned regularly.\n\n3. After prolonged use, the heater may accumulate scale, which needs to be cleaned regularly as it may affect the heating efficiency of the heater.\n\n4. Periodically clean the alkali tank and boric acid tank.\n\nThe above shared information covers the function, principle, features, and maintenance of the Kjeldahl nitrogen analyzer.

        "content": "Skipping easy courses is an essential skill for college students (Real analysis\nIt is often seen from peers complaining that there is a common phenomenon of a large number of easy courses in college nowadays. These courses must be taken by students, but they generally think they are unimportant, some even unrelated to their majors. However, they occupy a certain amount of credit and affect the GPA. They feel wasting time when learning them seriously.\nUndoubtedly, easy courses are entirely unnecessary to attend. If there’s an opportunity to skip, then skip (decide based on chances and your intent), or it is more important to do things you really want or need during these classes. For example, preparing for certification exams, studying other subjects, reading books, watching documentaries or online courses, memorizing vocabulary, etc. All these are means, but your purpose should be kept in mind. Be result-oriented.\nIt’s not about disrespecting teachers; the so-called easy course implies the teacher itself doesn't respect students. Both sides act unseriously, so with mutual disrespect, don’t feel guilty. It’s better to use class time to do what you need or to skip for meaningful goals following your heart.\nTeachers clearly know their courses are for credits. They 100% will provide students with test passes using focused highlights. There's no need to listen to the first few weeks, but the last two weeks are crucial. Pay attention to what teachers highlight, take notes, and memorize them. Especially seek advice from upper-year students about past exam questions.\nIn reality, competition mainly happens in the last two weeks to see who has the better attitude and works harder.\n\nNote not to skip classes aimlessly.

        "content": "The benefits of wearing pure silver jewelry😊\nMany people like to wear silver jewelry in their daily lives because silver jewelry can effectively reflect the health condition of the human body. If the body is excessively damp, the silver jewelry on one's body will turn black.\nSilver bracelets are also a type of jewelry that many women like to wear. Compared to their emotional or spiritual value, silver bracelets are relatively inexpensive and have significant effects. So, what are the functions and effects of wearing silver bracelets on the body? 1. Benefits of wearing silver bracelets\n1. Wearing silver bracelets has the effect of warding off evil spirits. This is one of the reasons why many children wear silver bracelets—it can ward off diseases, dispel demons, and protect children as they grow up safely.\n2. Silver bracelets can absorb toxins. When the body contains toxins, the silver bracelet can absorb them. At this time, the silver bracelet will turn increasingly black. Typically, bracelets worn by healthy individuals do not turn black, while those worn by less healthy individuals will become darker.\nTherefore, wearing silver bracelets can help eliminate toxins in the body. 3. Silver has excellent sterilization effects. If you use a silver bowl to hold water, it can extend the water's usability. Thus, wearing silver jewelry over a long period can reduce bacteria in the body.\n2. Maintenance of silver bracelets 1. When wearing silver bracelets, do not wear other metal jewelry. When doing housework, try to take them off to prevent accidents that may cause deformation or scratches.\n2. Avoid frequently touching the silver bracelet with your hands or scraping it vigorously, as this accelerates oxidation. 3. When removing the silver bracelet, use a cotton cloth or a wet wipe to clean it, remove any surface dirt, and store the bracelet in a sealed bag.\n4. Remove the silver bracelet when going underwater or taking a bath, as prolonged water exposure accelerates oxidation. 5. Silver bracelets or chains can easily oxidize and lose their luster after being worn for some time. You can clean them at professional silver cleaning stores or clean them yourself at home.\nIf the oxidation is not severe, you can scrub the surface with toothpaste or purchase professional silver cleaning solutions.",

        "content": "Balcony flower cultivation red and black list❗️Tips for newbies to avoid pitfalls\n⚫️⚫️【Black list】\n❎️Orchids\nReason: Orchids have strict environmental requirements, especially preferring well-ventilated and humid environments. If ventilation is poor in a humid environment, they are prone to pests and diseases, and sometimes root rot.\n.\n❎️Begonias\nReason: Begonias have strict requirements for ventilation, sunlight, and humidity. If ventilation is poor and the soil remains wet after watering, root rot can easily occur. Moreover, in low-ventilation and low-sunlight conditions, their normal growth is hindered, causing yellowing and leaf drop. In such situations, they are also susceptible to pests and diseases.\n.\n❎️Azalea\nReason: Closed balconies are not suitable for azaleas because they require well-ventilated environments and slightly acidic soil and water. If these conditions are not met, yellowing, leaf drop, or even wilting and death may occur.\n.\n\n❎️Hydrangea\nReason: In poorly ventilated environments, high heat and humidity are common, making hydrangeas susceptible to pests and diseases. Additionally, the entire hydrangea plant is toxic, especially the pollen, which can trigger pollen allergies in a closed balcony and cause discomfort.\n.\n❎️Rose\nReason: Roses thrive in well-ventilated environments. In poorly ventilated conditions, high heat and humidity make roses prone to pests and diseases, which is why many flower enthusiasts refer to them as \"medicine jars.\"\n.\n🔴🔴【Red list】\n✅️Kalanchoe\nReason: Just a couple of kalanchoe pots on the balcony can create a sea of flowers. Place them under sufficient sunlight and water thoroughly when the soil dries. Maintain temperatures around 15-25 degrees Celsius. Use potassium dihydrogen phosphate after flower buds appear, spraying every 7-10 days.\n.\n✅️Pelargonium\nReason: When pelargonium blooms, it does so enthusiastically, forming large flower balls. Even a few pots create a stunning floral display. Crucially, pelargonium is easy to cultivate, dislikes excessive watering, and enjoys warm sunlight. As long as winter temperatures exceed 15 degrees Celsius, it can bloom continuously.\n.\n\n✅️Verbena\nReason: Heat-tolerant verbena can keep flowering even when temperatures exceed 30 degrees Celsius. During its growing season, fertilize every 15 days using a nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium compound, which promotes both growth and flowering.\n.\n✅️Pentas\nReason: Pentas come in many colors, such as pink, crimson, peach, and white. To turn a balcony into a garden, grow one pot of each variety. It will keep blooming, creating a floral sea year-round.\n.\n✅️Bougainvillea\nReason: Although bougainvillea blooms less during winter and spring, its summer and autumn blossoms are dazzling. A single bougainvillea plant can create a sea of flowers. During the hot summer, when many flowers bloom sparingly, bougainvillea stands out, continuing to create floral displays even in extreme heat.\n.\n\n#BalconyFlowerCultivation[topic]#  #FlowerCareKnowledgeSharing[topic]#  #GreenPlantsAndFlowers[topic]#  #LoveLifeLoveFlowers[topic]#",

Without it, the car can’t start, nor can it power the electronic devices inside.🚘 How to charge it becomes a concern for many car owners.🤔\n\nA car battery can be charged using a charger. Additionally, the car battery can also charge while the car is running, so there’s no need for manual handling.🚗 If the battery is still functional, the car starts fine, and electronic devices work as expected, driving at high speed for about 1~2 hours can fully charge the battery.⏰\n\nHowever, if the car’s power is completely drained—for example, if you’ve parked the car in a corner and didn’t use it for several days—the battery will gradually discharge. Over time, the battery may become too weak, making it impossible to start the car.😱 If you encounter this issue, resolve it promptly to avoid affecting battery lifespan.⚠️\n\nFurthermore, if your car battery is low, you can use another car to jump-start it—a common method in daily life.👥 Simply park the two cars close together, connect the positive terminals to each other, and the negative terminals to each other. Use the jump-starting method to get the low-power car running, and after driving for a while, the car battery will recharge.🔋\n\nThere are many ways to charge a car battery. It can be charged directly in the car, removed for charging, or charged during driving.🔄 Once you master these methods, you won’t need to worry about battery issues.😊\n\nI hope this information helps.

Last time on the plane, I saw many people with registration cards who still used the foreigner channel after getting off the plane. The foreigner channel had a long queue. I really wanted to shout with a loudspeaker [Shy emoji]. First, it’s tiring for oneself to queue, and it also increases the waiting time for those without registration cards. Also, please inform your parents when you see this, as I've noticed some elderly people with registration cards are also unsure and queue at the foreigner channel. #Korea[hashtag]# #KoreaEntry[hashtag]# #IncheonAirport[hashtag]#",

Pi Xiu feeds on wealth and treasures, so naturally, it brings abundance to its wearer.\nHowever, there are some rules to follow when wearing it. Do you know what they are?\nToday, let me summarize some tips for wearing Pi Xiu [SmileR][SmileR][SmileR]\n1. Choose a large Pi Xiu\nWhen men wear Pi Xiu, they should choose a larger one for a more imposing aura. Women, on the other hand, can opt for a smaller, more delicate Pi Xiu for a charming look.\n2. Wear it on the left hand\nAs the saying goes, \"Left for income, right for outflow.\" Therefore, when wearing a Pi Xiu bracelet, it should be on the left hand to attract wealth. When wearing a pendant, the head of the Pi Xiu should face upward to absorb spiritual energy and attract more fortune.\n3. Handle with care\nPi Xiu is a very sacred creature, so don’t let others touch it carelessly. Also, treasure your Pi Xiu; avoid exposing it to water, such as during baths or menstrual periods, when it must be removed.\n4. Avoid not wearing it for long periods\nGolden Pi Xiu is very spiritual and may feel neglected by its owner, potentially causing a negative impact. Therefore, wear it frequently to build a closer bond with it.\n5. Head direction\nThe head direction of the Pi Xiu is crucial: when wearing a bracelet, let its head face outward for wealth attraction, and for pendants, let the head face upward to absorb spiritual energy better.\n6. Frequent touching\nPi Xiu not only protects wealth but also enhances luck and mitigates disasters. Thus, touch it often to increase your mutual bond.\n7. Day and night adjustment\nWhen wearing Pi Xiu during the day, let it align with you to attract wealth. At night, let its head face inward to leave prosperity for your family, aligning with traditional Buddhist values.\n8. Suitable for all\nPi Xiu suits everyone, but those who are physically frail, too young, or too old need to be cautious and should preferably not wear it.\n9. Value preservation\nEveryone wants to have a Pi Xiu as their guardian of wealth, so be sure to protect your Pi Xiu well to let it guard your family’s fortune better.\n#Bracelet[Topic]##WealthPiXiu[Topic]# #AccessorySharing[Topic]# #QA[Topic]#",

After more than ten days of training, I was finally able to book the exam. There was intensive training for three days before the test. Everyone got up very early, and I woke up half an hour earlier each day than the previous day. On the exam day, I got up around five o'clock. When I arrived at the test site, many people were already queuing. My number wasn’t too late, around 70. It was expected to finish before 12 pm. It took more than five hours from reaching the test site to the actual exam. Finally, it was my turn. I felt a bit nervous while waiting, but once I sat in the car, I was relatively calm. After the right-angle turn, I forgot to deactivate the turn signal, losing 10 points. Until walking out of the S-curve, I heard the broadcast: Congratulations, you passed the test. I felt all the practice during summer was worth it. However, I don't want to undergo another three-day intensive training ever again. As I left the test site, I happily told the security guard that I wouldn’t need to come back anymore.\nA warm reminder to all brothers and sisters who are about to take the test: The exam isn’t as complicated as dealing with social intricacies, but in China, wherever there are people, there are relationships and “Chinese-style” connections. However, strength lies in your preparation. As long as you’ve practiced well, feeling nervous during the exam is normal. Just remind yourself to stay calm—it’s no big deal. As long as you're still in the test, stay steady and don’t let your guard down.\nLastly, I must recommend my driving school: Tengfei Driving School is really great, and the instructors are patient and willing to teach. Many students from different schools joined during the intensive training. You can tell that some schools aren’t as good, so choosing Tengfei is definitely the right choice.\nWhen it comes to exams, nervousness arises only when you’re unprepared or lacking confidence! #SubjectTwoExam[Topic]#  #DrivingSchoolLearning[Topic]#  Hoping to pass Subject Three smoothly [FoldedHands][FoldedHands][FoldedHands]",

Vomit usually consists of undigested food or white foam-like liquid.\n● Middle stage: Diarrhea begins, with stool appearing yellow or grayish-yellow and often accompanied by a foul odor. As the condition worsens, the stool turns tomato juice-like or soy sauce-like due to severe damage to the intestinal mucosa, leading to bleeding.\n● Late stage: Dogs may suffer from severe dehydration, sunken eyes, loss of skin elasticity, and significant weight loss. Without timely treatment, they could die from dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and shock.\n● Myocarditis type: Common in puppies, this form usually develops rapidly with no apparent early symptoms. Sudden difficulty in breathing, accelerated heart rate, and heart failure might occur, potentially leading to death within a short time.\n🌟Causes🌟\n● Viral infection: Parvovirus is the primary cause. This virus is highly resilient and can survive in the environment for an extended period. Healthy dogs can get infected through direct contact with the feces, urine, saliva, or other secretions of infected dogs or by coming into contact with items contaminated with these secretions (e.g., food bowls, toys, mats).\n● Weak immunity: Dogs that have not been vaccinated or incompletely vaccinated have weaker resistance to parvovirus and are more susceptible to infection. Puppies, older dogs, and dogs with compromised immunity due to other illnesses are also at higher risk.\n● Stress factors: Situations like sudden environmental changes (e.g., moving, boarding), long-distance transport, or fright may suppress the dog's immune system, increasing the risk of parvovirus infection.\n🌟Treatment🌟\n● Fasting and water restriction: To reduce the gastrointestinal burden and avoid irritating the intestines, fasting and water restriction are often required during treatment. The duration depends on the condition and is determined by a veterinarian.\n● Fluid therapy: Intravenous fluid therapy helps replenish water, electrolytes, and nutrients to correct dehydration, maintain acid-base balance, and supply energy. This is crucial for severely ill dogs unable to eat.\n● Medications:\n● Antiviral drugs: Such as antibodies, serums, etc., to help dogs resist viral infections.\n● Antiemetic drugs: To alleviate vomiting symptoms.\n● Antidiarrheal drugs: To reduce diarrhea symptoms, e.g., montmorillonite powder, but note that antidiarrheal drugs shouldn't be used too early to prevent toxin accumulation in the body.\n● Antibiotics: To prevent secondary infections, such as cephalosporins.\n● Hemostatic drugs: For dogs experiencing intestinal bleeding.\n#DogParvovirus[Topic]# #DogIllness[Topic]# #DogHealth[Topic]# #PetDogs[Topic]# #Dogs[Topic]# #PetKnowledge[Topic]# #PetTopics[Topic]# #PetDoctorConsultation[Topic]# #Dog[Topic]# #DogDiary[Topic]#",

        "content": "How to communicate when giving gifts?\nThere are three basic principles for appropriate expressions:\n1. Altruism: Maintain an altruistic mindset and think about how to create value for others.\n2. Propriety: Respect privacy and avoid discussing serious matters.\n3. Expression: Show gratitude, release goodwill, and focus on emotions. The gift is merely a medium to enhance emotions.\nWhen giving gifts, pay attention to some taboos:\n1. Do not speak too quickly; think before expressing yourself.\n2. Try to time the gift-giving appropriately; avoid long-winded speeches to prevent awkwardness for both parties. Do not overpromise.\n3. Also, when seeking help via gift-giving, do not have too high expectations. Helping you is an act of kindness, not an obligation, so do not overly force it.\n4. Moreover, when giving gifts, be decisive; do not procrastinate, especially when asking for favors. Proper setup is enough; avoid digressing as it may appear petty.\n5. Maintain a graceful and sincere attitude; no need for excessive humility.\n6. For general gifts, with modest value (e.g., local specialties), there is no need for elaborate explanations—just leave them directly.\n7. For expensive gifts, it's necessary to provide the recipient with a reason. In Chinese culture, reciprocity is important. If your gift is too valuable, it may be difficult for the other party to reciprocate. Therefore, provide a valid justification, such as gratitude for their support or care.\nWhen facing rejection, it can be categorized into two scenarios:\nWhen someone symbolically declines:\n1. Change the gift's subject: For example, say \"XX asked me to deliver this to you, to thank you for all your help.\" This way, the other party will feel less inclined to refuse and put you in an awkward position.\n2. Target specific relationships: Give gifts to their children or elders as a token of your appreciation.\n3. Utilize a loss narrative: For instance, you can say that the person has already done you a great favor and that you can't let them bear additional costs, so this is just a small token of gratitude.\n4. Use safekeeping as a pretext: When seeking assistance, politely say that the gift is temporarily left with them, considering they still need to coordinate on your behalf.\n5. Say \"just this one time\": Be humble and polite, emphasizing this will be a one-off occurrence.\nWhen the rejection is firm:\nIt may be due to the gift being too valuable, being looked down upon, distrust, or inability to offer help. In such cases, the gift is unlikely to be accepted, but taking it back directly can be awkward.\n1. If the recipient is a girlfriend, you can jokingly say, \"Are you testing me? I will surely withstand the test of time.\"\n2. If the recipient is a boss, you can mention, \"You are truly incorruptible. Working under you is my great fortune and a source of reassurance.\"\n3. If the recipient is a friend, you can quip, \"Are you returning this because you're underestimating me? Or is it because you know I might be facing financial difficulties lately, and you're returning this to help me out!\"\n#GiftGiving[Topic]#  #EmotionalIntelligence[Topic]#  #HighEQ[Topic]#",

Don't fall for the popular new cotton quilts during Double 11! \nFor those sisters who still don't know how to choose winter cotton quilts, don't search randomly‼\nRandom searches make people 👀 dizzy and unable to choose properly 😪\nEspecially for sisters 👭 with decision anxiety, don't blindly chase big brands or follow trends 🌬\nHere are some notes on choosing cotton quilts 📝 compiled overnight for sisters in need—save them quickly~\n——\n⚠ Pay attention to these when buying quilts\n1. Inferior Cotton\nSome unscrupulous merchants use inferior cotton to fill cotton quilts. Inferior cotton is usually made from industrial waste, old clothing, etc., which not only lacks warmth but can also harm human health. When purchasing, carefully observe the color and texture of the cotton.\n2. Cotton Content\nCotton quilts are not better with higher cotton content. Pure cotton tends to clump and shift, making it heavy on the body. Nowadays, most cotton quilts are made with over 50% cotton content combined with silk fiberfill, making them warm, lightweight, and resistant to clumping and shifting.\n3. Material Quality\nThe fabric of cotton quilts is also crucial. The material should be soft, comfortable, breathable, and moderately durable. Avoid choosing rough and irritating fabrics.\n——\n✨ Cool Xiaoqi Cotton Quilt—【Lightweight and Warm】\nThis quilt smells naturally of cotton when opened. It has a consistent, substantial filling, covering even the edges carefully. I bought one last year and it worked really well. Now I've bought another for my dorm. It's lightweight and warm, and I personally don't like the heavy, oppressive feeling. The fabric feels smooth and is very comfortable for sleeping.\n✨ Bamboo Maiden Cotton Quilt—【Fluffy and Comfortable】\nThis quilt is finely crafted with no extra threads, doesn't deform, and has aligned stitching on the edges. It feels soft and is skin-friendly, being both warm and lightweight when used.\n✨ Mercury Home Textiles Quilt—【Thin and Silky】\nThis quilt has only a slight smell upon arrival. Its weight is sufficient, and airing it under the sun removes the odor. Some areas had exposed cotton and threads, but the customer service resolved the issue quickly.\n✨ MUJI Cotton Quilt—【Good Wrap-around Feel】\nThis quilt has exquisite packaging as described by the seller. The fabric is comfortable to the touch, the craftsmanship is good, and the quilt has no peculiar odor.\n\n#Quilt[topic]# #QuiltCore[topic]# #QuiltRecommendation[topic]# #QuiltCoreRecommendation[topic]# #CottonQuilt[topic]# #CottonFilledQuilt[topic]# #LittleRedBookHomeLifestyleFestival[topic]# #AffordableQuiltRecommendation[topic]# #SuitableForStudentsQuilt[topic]# #AnnualHappinessItem[topic]# #WinterQuiltRecommendation[topic]# #UsefulQuilt[topic]# #Double11[topic]# #HowToChooseAQuilt[topic]# #DormQuiltWeight[topic]# #WinterWarmQuiltRecommendation[topic]# #CottonQuiltRecommendation[topic]# #AffordableQuilt[topic]# #CanSleepNakedQuilt[topic]# #WrapSnuglyInMySmallQuilt[topic]# #XinjiangCotton[topic]# #XinjiangCottonQuilt[topic]# #Handmade[topic]# #Bedding[topic]# #Double11ShoppingFestival[topic]#",

        "content": "📝 Never learn the Oxford Tree!!!!!\n🌳 The Oxford Tree, as a highly renowned graded reading series, is highly praised by parents and students. However, it is not very suitable for children with zero foundation. Let's see why the Oxford Tree is not suitable for zero-based children?\n🎯 High English vocabulary requirement of the Oxford Tree\nFirstly, for children with zero foundation, learning English is like an unknown maze, but the Oxford Tree lacks clear guidance, which can make them feel confused and frustrated, and the vocabulary requirement is too high, making it difficult for zero-based children to keep up, thus affecting their interest and enthusiasm in learning.\n👂 The Oxford Tree has too many version choices\nIt seems to be an advantage that parents can choose teaching materials based on their child's English level, but parents need to spend a lot of time and effort to choose the right teaching materials for their children, and they need to keep trying and making mistakes. Commonly seen on the market are the imported original version and the domestic version. Let's briefly explain how to distinguish between these two versions.\n💡 Imported Original Version: The Kadok version we often talk about is also divided into school version and home version, with a relatively higher price, and only supports the Caterpillar dot reading\n1⃣ Kadok School Version: The Oxford Tree reading series introduced by Kadok, including the extended reading and natural phonics series.\n2⃣ Home Version: Introduced from the Read with Biff, Chip & Kipper series, it does not overlap with the school version and is a supplementary extracurricular reading material for parents to read with their children at home, but the content is relatively less rich than the school version.\n💪 Domestic Version: Some printing factories print without copyright authorization and have not introduced it. Compared with the original version, it has a price advantage and is divided into unmarked, red label, orange label, rainbow flower, gold label, etc. Different labels are used to distinguish different printing factories, with some differences in pages, quality, and color, but no significant differences in other aspects.\n1⃣ Unmarked Version - High-definition printing, few errors, closer to the original version in color and layout, with 24 wordless books in the front, and its level 1-2 does not include traditional stories.\n2⃣ Red Label Version - Good for levels 1-2, average quality for levels 3-9. Cheap and cost-effective.\n3⃣ Orange Label Version - More volumes, more dot reading functions, the main story books for levels 1-2 expanded to 150 books, 18 more than other versions, and levels 3-9 also include a parent guidance manual with Chinese translation.\n5⃣ Rainbow Flower All-Rounder Version - Also known as the 'All-Rounder Cow', it is the only domestic version that introduces natural phonics, with a total of 48 books for L1-L2 phonics.\n6⃣ Gold Label: Launched in 2020, currently only available for L1-L5.\n💡 For children with zero foundation, the Oxford Tree should not be blindly chosen as their English learning material. The underlying logic of English in the Oxford Tree is difficult to understand, overly relies on listening, and has too many version choices, all of which can bring difficulties and obstacles to children's learning. However, if the child has an English foundation, the appropriate Oxford Tree teaching material should be chosen to provide a better learning experience and help for the child, after all, the Oxford Tree itself is a relatively good teaching material. 💪\n#English Education Sharing [Topic]# #How to Do English Enlightenment [Topic]#",

However, when faced with choices, most people either let others arrange things for them or, with their limited knowledge, dive into action without much thought.\n.\nSo how should one make relatively rational choices?\n.\nThis book, 'The Art of Decision-Making,' is written by three senior experts skilled in solving tough decision-making problems, distilling the essence of 40 years of research and practical experience. It provides a set of decision-making methods that offer good reference points for making smart decisions.\n.\nDecision Element 1: Problem\n🧐What seems obvious and intuitive may not be the real issue. Look at routine problems from a new perspective, investigate their causes, and propose questions using creative methods.\n🧐Turn problems into opportunities. Ask yourself: What can I gain from this situation? What are the opportunities?\n🧐To ask the right questions, first write down your initial assessment of the basic issue, then question it, test it, and refine it. Ask what triggered this decision and why it should be considered.\n🧐Question the constraints in the problem statement and identify the key elements of the problem.\n🧐Seek novel insights by asking others for their views on the situation.\n\n.\nDecision Element 2: Goal\nHow to find the right goal\nStep 1: Expand and refine your original views using different perspectives, and create a wish list.\nStep 2: Convert your concerns into concise goals.\nStep 3: Keep asking why? Separate the goal from the means to determine your fundamental goal.\nStep 4: Clarify the significance of each goal to you.\nStep 5: Test your goals to see if they align with your interests.\n\n.\nDecision Element 3: Alternatives\nAfter finding the first possible solution, consider if there are better ones. Ask more about how to do it. The limitations of assumptions are imaginary rather than real obstacles. High standards will force you to think in new ways. Learn from experience and seek others' opinions.\n.\nElement 4: Results\nConstruct a results table listing the possible outcomes of each alternative.\nImagine the impact of the current decision on the future and the scenario that will be realized. Describe it with a unified scale and accurate numbers. Eliminate obviously unfavorable alternatives. Write a brief description of specific goals and specific alternatives.\n.\nElement 5: Trade-offs\nElimination method + equivalent substitution method\nFor multiple alternatives, eliminate goals that are the same across alternatives (rational, measurable) and use the advantages and disadvantages to eliminate options.\n.\nElement 6: Uncertainty\nUse a decision tree to consider each factor that might affect the outcome and how significant its impact could be. When there are many potential uncertainties, screen out the few that could have the most significant impact.\n.\nElement 7: Risk Tolerance\nScore your desire for each outcome and calculate the overall desire contribution of each outcome to its corresponding alternative. Calculate the total desire score for each alternative.\n.\nElement 8: Related Decisions\nMaking smart choices for related decisions hinges on good advance planning. #Reading Notes Check-in [Topic]# #Decision Analysis [Topic]# #Reading [Topic]#",

The mountain attractions are further divided into the West Line (natural landscapes like Ruqin Lake, Immortal's Cave, Jinxiu Valley, etc.), the Central Line (cultural attractions like Meilu Villa, meeting site, etc.), and the East Line (natural landscapes like Hanpo Pass, Five Old Peaks, Sandie Spring, etc.). The foothill attractions include White Deer Cave Academy, Donglin Giant Buddha, and Xiufeng.\n[RainbowR]Note: If you purchase the Lushan Combo Ticket (160r), it includes all mountain and foothill attractions, but the mountain and foothill attractions are not interlinked.\n[OneR]Waterfall Tour (Recommended to stay in Xiufeng or Lushan East Gate)\nSuitable for: People with limited travel time, just one to one and a half days, wanting only to see the waterfalls.\nThere are two main waterfall attractions in Lushan: Sandie Spring (the last attraction on the East Line of the mountain scenic area) and Xiufeng (the foothill area of the scenic area, with waterfalls depicted in the poetry of Li Bai).\nTravel route: Xiufeng - Lushan East Gate - Sandie Spring\n[RainbowR]Note: Since it does not enter the core mountain scenic area of Lushan except for Sandie Spring, you can choose to buy only tickets for Xiufeng and Sandie Spring.\nThe route from Lushan East Gate to Sandie Spring is basically flat, but returning from Sandie Spring to the East Line bus stop for mountain transportation requires climbing 1,200 steps (about an 800-meter elevation). Therefore, unless you have good physical strength, it will be quite challenging to visit other mountain attractions. Additionally, Lushan East Gate is some distance from the two train stations.\n[TwoR]Lushan Leisure Tour (Recommended to stay in Guling Town)\nSuitable for: People with relatively ample travel time, about two to three days, with average physical strength, exploring both mountain and foothill attractions.\nGuling Town is a small town on the summit. To reach it, you can either take a shuttle bus from Lushan South Gate or North Gate (round trip 20r, about 1 hour, with many turns, not recommended for those who get carsick easily), or take the cable car (round trip 120r, about 20 minutes, smooth). Both the shuttle bus and cable car end at Guling Town, and luggage can be brought along. You may contact your mountain hotel in advance for pick-up and drop-off.\nAdvantages: Cool and refreshing, Guling Town’s commercial facilities are more developed compared to the foothill area, with a wider range of accommodation options.\nTravel itinerary: Day 1 West Line: You can walk from Ruqin Lake through Jinxiu Valley to Immortal's Cave, taking about 3-4 hours, then take the mountain transport bus (70r, valid for seven days and recommended for connecting most mountain attractions) back to the main street for a meal.\nDay 2 Visit the Central Line and East Line: Hanpo Pass - Five Old Peaks - Sandie Spring.\n[RainbowR]If you have good physical strength, you can consider visiting both Sandie Spring and Five Old Peaks together. If not, choose one.\nThe mountain transport bus only stops at the entrance to the Sandie Spring Scenic Area. You can either walk from the first tier to the second tier in about 1 hour or take a small train. From the second tier to the third tier, it's downhill steps, about 1,200 steps (an 800m elevation drop).\nIf you’re not physically strong or are traveling with children, consider walking from Sandie Spring to Lushan East Gate (4km, flat road), then taking a taxi from the East Gate to the North Gate (closer, about 40r) or South Gate (farther, but you can pass Xiufeng, White Deer Cave Academy, and Donglin Giant Buddha along the way; South Gate open status depends on scenic area announcements).\nLushan tickets are valid for seven days and can be used for multiple entries. Whether you re-enter depends on luggage storage; consider returning to the train station, but the downhill route from Sandie Spring is quite steep and not suitable for carrying large amounts of luggage.\n#Lushan[topic]# #LushanTravel[topic]# #SandieSpring[topic]# #Xiufeng[topic]# #LushanAccommodation[topic]# #LushanTravelGuide[topic]#",

        "content": "Major warning about Jingdong International self-operated store! Consumer trap! Rights protection advice\nI rarely speak out, but I'm doing so now to warn everyone, especially my fellow sisters, never to buy important items from Jingdong International self-operated store! It can engage in false advertising and sell products from unclear channels, passing fakes as real, just because JD International is registered in Hong Kong and is not under the jurisdiction of 315, allowing it to exploit legal loopholes. If you unfortunately encounter quality issues with your purchase, the complaint process will be extremely troublesome. I'm sharing this bitter lesson with everyone. Here's what happened:\nOn June 18, I ordered an Apple iPad from the Jingdong International self-operated store [Apple Certified Refurbished Jingdong Self-operated Store]. Note that it's an [officially refurbished unit]! The merchant's advertisement and customer service both claimed that it comes with a one-year global Apple warranty, which is why I decided to purchase it.\nHardly used, the iPad started experiencing multiple crashes, purple screen reboots, and battery dropping to zero while watching videos. When I asked for a return or exchange, customer service said they only handle repairs after 7 days. So, I got the purchase receipt and went to Apple for inspection. After waiting for 10 days, they gave me an invoice with gibberish as the header. I started a complaint on the Jingdong page, and then received a call from JD customer service, saying I could send it to the 35th floor of AiHua Computer Building in Shenzhen Futian for JD after-sales [pay-on-delivery] inspection and repair. I said I would go to the Apple store, and they said [that's also fine, but we might have more spare parts than your local Apple store], which didn't sound right.\nAt the Apple store, a series of inspections failed to find any issues. They suggested sending it to the official repair center and asked for the purchase receipt.\nIn August, Apple replied via email, stating that the product did not meet the repair conditions and would not be repaired. I appealed to Apple's after-sales for an explanation. The final response from the appeals department was that it was not due to man-made damage or disassembly, but because the relevant department verified that both the product and the purchase receipt did not meet the two necessary conditions: [the authenticity of the receipt and issuance from the original dealer channel]. In layman's terms, [this is not an officially sourced product, and Apple refuses to warranty it], but the official wording was [the product does not meet repair conditions].\nI used Apple's reply to negotiate with Jingdong, but the merchant insisted that [not meeting repair conditions is not a refusal of warranty, but just not meeting one of Apple's warranty policies; they asked Apple to provide proof of refusal, and after confirmation, the store would handle the repair]. As you can see, from customer service to the merchant, Jingdong International self-operated store has been confusing and misleading, making unscrupulous arguments, trying to extinguish the fire by handling repairs in the store, but who knows what kind of black market shop they'll send it to and what kind of second-hand parts they'll use??\nDuring this period, I complained to 12315 about three Jingdong-related companies, but ultimately, because Jingdong International is registered in Hong Kong and not under their jurisdiction, 12315 terminated the case. Currently, the Hong Kong Consumer Council is handling it, and they also suggested I report to the Hong Kong Police. I am pursuing multiple avenues and will update on the progress, hoping to help sisters who have encountered similar fraud!\nBut here's the irony! The latest update is that the store's original [one-year global official warranty] has changed to [1-year warranty], and the page has removed [one-year global official warranty], only mentioning in small print that official refusal of warranty is possible. Isn't this a clear sign of fraudulent behavior? I urge everyone to avoid and boycott such stores that bully customers and operate behind a huge black chain! #JingdongInternationalSelf-operated[Topic]# #JingdongInternational[Topic]# #Jingdong[Topic]# #iPad[Topic]# #iPadPro[Topic]#",

If you don't adapt, it's fine, I'll root and modify the parameters myself, but it turns out that this one is particularly difficult to unlock the bootloader, and the system optimization is also 💩. Here are some points that must be criticized in terms of daily use:\n🌸 The white bar at the bottom of the full-screen gesture screen cannot be manually canceled\n🌸 There are three dots at the top of the screen that cannot be canceled, they are always there, whether watching TV or playing games. When you click on those three dots, a small window pops up asking you to choose between opening a small window or splitting the screen to the left or right.

        "content": "New season Zhaojun tips\nProven 80+ win rate, Zhaojun can also climb high ranks\n\nEquipment can copy my Yixing notes setup\nJust that as ranks improve, teammates' awareness and mechanics slightly change. They'll use their expertise and strengths, might take some of your lane farm. We should adjust the hero's playstyle to maximize win rate.\n1200-1500: Picking Yixing can compensate for teammates who are not confident in standing in vision areas, or C-position teammates who can't deal enough damage. Yixing can force teamfights, create momentum, provide critical control and damage during teamfights, along with some minor slows.\n1500-1800: Picking Zhaojun can make up for teammates who are prone to being picked off. She can clear waves solo to minimize losses, block enemy positioning during teamfights, and use her ultimate to provide key slow and AoE damage. She has some self-preservation and solo kill ability but has lower error tolerance compared to Yixing. This requires better awareness. Mechanically, landing freezes isn't too critical, but hitting them is preferable. Whether you hit them or not can affect the game's advantage and win rate.\nAt this stage, teammates will heavily consume your lane farm; get used to it. It's not about utility hero issues— even heroes like Fire Dance or Wan'er will see four teammates sharing a mid-lane wave at six minutes. Thus, Zhaojun isn't very economy-dependent. She just needs enough to scale for later damage. Even if teamfights are lost, she can clear waves solo to stall for teammates' respawns. Always keep an eye on the minimap, stick close to teammates, maintain a safe distance, and be ready to support quickly.\nMomentum usually heads towards the development lane. If the development lane is freed up, try sneaking into the confrontation lane for a gank. If the opponent's confrontation lane is occupied by dull lane warriors, they can be ganked; if it’s heroes like Guan Yu, Mulan, or Lian Po, forget it—they can counter you easily.\nDuring this phase, teammates will engage on their own. Especially the off-laners and junglers are very proactive. The marksman will hesitate to follow up. During teamfights, you should use your ultimate to block areas based on your teammates' engages, freeze enemies with your skills one and two, and deal damage.\nWhen ambushing, it’s best to use skill two first to freeze, then use skill one and basic attacks for damage.\nFamiliarize yourself with Zhaojun's skills and passive shield timings. Play around this timing in fights. After the passive shield is broken, casting her ultimate can instantly refresh it. The damage and slow effect from these two shields alone can sometimes turn the tide of a fight.\nSkill one has a large vision radius. Learn to maximize its effectiveness for scouting (Refer to image 4).\nI’ve posted a key point you can use for reference, though there are many more points I can’t summarize at the moment. Explore them yourselves, particularly on both left and right mid-bushes commonly used by Zhaojun players.\n\nAs for equipment, Zhaojun isn't suited for blood-sucking items. The lifesteal effect is negligible compared to Yixing. So, instead of going for lifesteal items, use Oblivion Staff. Error tolerance is slightly lower this way, and it depends on your proficiency with Zhaojun. If you feel unsafe, swap Oblivion Staff for Night Harvester for added HP and cooldown reduction. Losing a bit of magic penetration isn’t a big deal.\nThis utility-to-half-core mage build has only been tested on Yixing and Zhaojun. It isn’t suitable for heroes like Bomb Cat or Ying Zheng due to their mechanisms. It’s most cost-effective to focus on Pain Mask or Night Harvester for cold damage buildup and harassment.\nIf you are stuck defending while losing late-game, swap your boots for cooldown boots to cast more ultimates.\nStay patient. Wait for the enemy to make mistakes. If you defend enough times, the pressure will shift to the enemy.\n\n#HonorOfKings[Topic]# #PeakMatch[Topic]# #WangZhaojun[Topic]# #MidLane[Topic]#",

Generally, students can only apply for a single-entry visa with a stay duration of about 15 days. From the visa issuance date, it's valid for three months. Plan your travel time accordingly.\n\n2⃣️. A recent 45mm X 35mm photo: It cannot be the photo from your passport; otherwise, it will be returned. I went to a Korean ID photo studio nearby about a week earlier for a quick and great photo. Remember to attach it to the application form before submission. Only use solid glue✔️.\n\n3⃣️. Flight and hotel bookings: Your itinerary must form a complete loop‼️. You can depart from your home country, but you must provide a full travel itinerary such as Auckland—home country—Japan—home country (if returning)—Auckland‼️. Domestic Japanese flights do not need to be purchased in advance; the visa focuses on international flights💡. Choose refundable hotels in case of changes👀.\n\n4⃣️. Schedule: Use the template provided on the official website, and be as detailed as possible about your activities during each time frame.\n\n5⃣️. Three months' bank statements (subject to frequent updates, based on the official website): I went to the bank to print mine on the day I submitted. Two days before that, I transferred funds from a secondary account‼️. Submit statements from the primary account. The bank printed only about two and a half months of statements for me, which made me worried there might be issues, but it went smoothly. There's no specific balance requirement; just enough to cover your itinerary✔️.\n\n6⃣️. Japanese application form: Download it from the official website. If you're unsure how to fill it out or certain sections are not applicable, simply write N/A! You can also look up guides online.\n\nVisa submission:\nAddress: 41 Shortland Street, 15th floor✔️\nOnce you exit the elevator, a friendly elderly man will ask why you're there and guide you inside. After submitting your materials, you wait about five minutes for the visa officer to check everything is complete.

This is a poor mindset. Actually, deep down, they still want to pass. Going with the intention of passing is a bit like missing the forest for the trees. If you treat the grading as practice and training, it should be in a suitable practice environment. One must reach the corresponding ability and level to practice, to achieve the positive meaning of practice;\n\n⚠️It is also not recommended for kindergarten children to take the grading exam. The grading competition is a highly competitive environment. The classroom is noisy, the teacher has to manage many children, some are crying, some are making noise, some cannot finish a game of chess, there are many older children, and parents are outside the classroom. Is it a bit like forcing a seedling to grow by pulling it up when you let a kindergarten child face such a strange environment alone?\n\n⚠️It is not recommended to take the grading exam if you have been learning chess for less than a year; although you can participate in the grading as long as you know how to play Go, and the first few levels are usually guaranteed to pass, it generally takes a year for a child to finish a game on a 19x19 large chessboard. It is recommended to start participating in the grading after being able to finish a complete large chessboard game.\n\nThere are grading exams every month. It is not too late to start after the child has a certain understanding of Go a year later.\n\n🔍Also, attached is the pass rate of the Shanghai Go Association grading exam, secrets cannot be revealed👀\n\n#Go Teaching[Topic]#  #Children's Go[Topic]#  #Youth Go[Topic]#  #Shanghai Go Upgrade[Topic]#  #Shanghai Go Promotion[Topic]#  #Shanghai Go Promotion Tournament[Topic]#  #Upgrade and Promotion Tournament[Topic]#",

The cheapest plan was 39 CNY, which included only data and no call time. At first, I was tempted, but then I asked about the additional SIM card. They said the extra SIM card required at least the minimum plan, which was also 39 CNY. Combined, it would be 78 CNY, about the same as what I had before. Later, I asked 10086 if there were other stores, and they recommended another one. I called and found their plan was 43 CNY per month, with similar data packages as the previous store but with lots of call time. The additional SIM card was only 10 CNY extra. Again, I was tempted. After thinking for a while, I realized that if there are such significant differences between plans at different stores, there might be an even better one. At that moment, I used Baidu Maps to search for nearby carrier outlets and called them. As expected, this plan was better, solving all issues related to data, calls, and the additional SIM card, and they even offered free broadband.

        "content": "Bluker Kamen Rider Star Edition Vol. 2 Big Hidden Blind Box Tips\nThis round can be said to be the top 1 most time-saving on the road to finding hidden items\n\nWeight and Tips: (Thanks to the accurate data provided by Hu Si Xiaobai)\n① End box without hidden: Kamen Rider 555 (Basic Faiz) around 66.5g to 66.7g, with desiccant\nNote: Unique weight! Unique weight! Unique weight! The heaviest in the whole end! There is a large bag of desiccant in the box! As long as there is more than 66g in the new end, it can be determined that there is no hidden item! And it can be 100% confirmed to be Kamen Rider 555 Basic! Equivalent to a bright box! Want the basic one? Just buy it!\n\n② End box with hidden: Kamen Rider 555 Burst Form around 62.8g to 63g, no desiccant!\nAs long as there is no more than 66g in the new end box, then the end box must have a big hidden item\n\nFirst, pick out those over 62g in the end box:\nKamen Rider Kabuto: around 62.4g with desiccant\nKamen Rider Chalice: around 62.4g to 62.6g without desiccant\nKamen Rider 555 Acceleration Form: around 62.4g to 63g with desiccant\nWolf Craft: around 62.4g to 63g with desiccant\nKamen Rider 555 Burst Form Big Hidden: around 62.8g to 63g without desiccant\n\nAfter picking out, just shake the box to hear the desiccant, find two blind boxes without desiccant, and choose the heaviest and closest to 63g one, which is the big hidden item (because the big hidden item has many parts and weapons, while Chalice only has the main body, so as long as the hot melt glue interference is small, the big hidden item must be heavier than Chalice)\n\nCurrently, this method and weight apply to codes ending in 41 to 43, if the new batch changes the weight distribution later, it won't work (the basic 555 weight might be adjusted to around 62g, but just listening to the desiccant is enough)\n\nPersonally, I think the Kamen Rider Star Edition Vol. 2 Big Hidden Kamen Rider 555 Burst Form is the most perfunctory and worst one among all Bluker new blind boxes!\n\nAt least the Ultraman Star 12 and Marvel Vol. 2 Big Hidden are fully painted, while the Kamen Rider Star Edition Vol. 2 Big Hidden main body red is all metallic red molded color, and most of the silver is also molded color! The weapon grip is also very weak, can't make any good poses. It looks very plasticky overall! No sincerity at all! The craftsmanship is not even as good as the first round of Extreme Fox Fire, and it is far inferior to Blazer Fadolan's initial birth and Iron Spiderman!\n\n#Trendy Toys[Topic]# #Bluker Ultraman[Topic]# #My Toy Share[Topic]# #Bluker[Topic]# #Bluker Kamen Rider[Topic]# #Bluker Kamen Rider Star Edition Vol. 2[Topic]# #Blind Box[Topic]# #Blind Box Hidden[Topic]# #My Blind Box Share[Topic]# #Kamen Rider[Topic]#",

        "content": "✅Detailed Parameters for Pour-over Coffee, Understand with One Image\nHello, I am Uncle Xiang, the manager of Itxiang Coffee with 15 years of experience, taking you through a little coffee knowledge with one image~\n\nIn the notes from the past few days, Uncle Xiang introduced a coffee recipe for the French press. Today, Uncle Xiang will use this Ethiopian Queen as an example to explain in detail the small details and common issues of making pour-over coffee with a v60.\n\nFirst, of course, is the water-to-coffee ratio. Different beans require slightly different ratios, generally between 15:1 and 20:1. Today, the Queen chosen by Uncle Xiang uses a ratio of 16:1. For example, if you choose 14g of coffee grounds for one serving, you need to add 224g of water.\n\n🌟Next is the amount of coffee liquid. The amount of coffee liquid is not equal to the amount of water added because some water remains in the coffee grounds during the extraction process. This lost water is approximately twice the amount of coffee grounds, so when using 14g of grounds, the lost water is about 14g*2=28g. The resulting coffee liquid is the total water added minus the lost water, 224g-28g=196g.\n\n🌟There is also a special step to note in pour-over coffee: blooming. This is the process of wetting the coffee grounds with the first pour of water and then quietly waiting for 20-30 seconds. The blooming of pour-over coffee does not require a lid because this process expels carbon dioxide from the coffee grounds, so you can see small bubbles coming out.\n\n❤️When pouring water again, we sometimes see small bubbles forming a brewing 'hamburger.' This bulging arc is mainly determined by the freshness of the coffee grounds. After grinding, the flavor compounds in coffee lose quickly, with the best tasting period being only one month. So, if the production/roasting date of the coffee grounds exceeds one month, it is difficult to see this brewing hamburger.\n\n❤️Additionally, the same beans roasted to different levels release different amounts of gas. Overall, light roasts have less carbon dioxide compared to dark roasts, so the blooming time can also be shorter.\n\nHave you encountered any other issues with pour-over coffee?

        "query": "Does Golden Retriever fear cold or heat?",
        "content": "Pet Care Science: What issues should be noted when raising a Golden Retriever in winter?\n1. Do not wear clothes\n\nAlthough Golden Retrievers can also feel cold, it is recommended not to frequently dress them in clothes during winter unless in extremely low temperatures, because Golden Retrievers inherently have a certain ability to withstand cold. If they are dressed in clothes for a long time, it can easily affect their own cold protection system, leading to a decrease in their immunity, making them more prone to catching a cold.\n\nAdditionally, because Golden Retrievers have relatively long fur, wearing clothes can cause friction on the fur, leading to fur tangling. Therefore, generally during winter, just preparing a thicker sleeping pad for the dog is sufficient. For puppies, you can also add a hot water bottle or electric heater.\n\n2. Do not bathe frequently\n\nMany dogs catch a cold in winter due to being exposed to the cold after bathing. Therefore, pet owners should not bathe their dogs frequently. In winter, due to lower temperatures, the metabolic rate of the dog's skin fat slows down, and the odor is not as strong, so there is no need to bathe them as frequently as in summer. It is generally recommended to bathe them at most once every 10-15 days, and the water temperature should be controlled around 38°C. After bathing, dry and blow-dry their fur immediately to prevent the dog from catching a cold.\n\n3. Regular deworming\n\nMany pet owners think that there is no need to deworm dogs in winter, which is a very wrong idea. Although most parasites are dormant in winter, this does not mean that dogs will not be infected. Some larvae may live on the dog throughout the winter, so dogs should also be dewormed regularly in winter. External deworming should be done once a month, and internal deworming can be done every 2-3 months.\n\n4. Regulate the gastrointestinal tract\n\nThe gastrointestinal tract of Golden Retrievers is relatively fragile, so attention should also be paid to the dog's gastrointestinal health in winter. Pet owners should pay special attention to the dog's daily drinking water, as many owners prepare a day's worth of water at once. However, in winter, the environmental temperature is lower, and the water temperature will also decrease with the air temperature. If the dog frequently drinks cold water, it can easily stimulate the gastrointestinal tract, potentially leading to symptoms such as gastrointestinal cold, diarrhea, or stomach cramps.\n\n5. Maintain exercise\n\nMany pet owners are reluctant to let their dogs play outside in winter due to concerns about them catching a cold. However, keeping dogs indoors for a long time can make them restless, which is not good for their physical and mental health. Therefore, Golden Retrievers should also maintain a certain amount of exercise in winter. During midday when the temperature is higher or the weather is good, you can take the Golden Retriever out to play, which can also help them absorb calcium by sunbathing, making their bones develop stronger.\n\n6. Appropriately supplement nutrition\n\nWhen the temperature is low in winter, dogs consume energy more quickly. Therefore, to enhance the Golden Retriever's ability to withstand cold, pet owners need to provide them with foods that are higher in nutritional value. In addition to regular dog food, you can also appropriately feed them foods such as chicken breast, egg yolk, beef, and goat milk to supplement their nutrition.\n\n#Dog [Topic]#  #Dog Daily [Topic]#  #Dog Raising [Topic]#  #Dog Raising Experience Sharing [Topic]#  #Beginner Dog Raising [Topic]#  #Pet [Topic]#  #Pet Raising [Topic]#  #Pet Raising Experience Sharing [Topic]#  #Pet Raising Daily [Topic]#",

        "content": "Guiyang Metro: Don't buy the City Pass when taking the metro, use UnionPay instead\nA bad experience in Guiyang starts with taking the metro. Searching for 'Ride Code' shows a redirect to City Pass, and as soon as you authorize, it asks you to buy a ticket. The ticket page shows that it can be used for the metro, but in reality, it can't. After searching for a long time, I found a hidden page with small print noting that only a few cities can use it for the metro, while other cities can only use it for buses... As a tourist who doesn't need to take the bus, discovering that I can't use it for the metro and must use Alipay's 'Yi Ying Qian Xing' or WeChat's 'Qian Shuang Bus' mini-program to top up, I wanted to refund the City Pass ticket, but it showed that it can't be refunded. So frustrating. If there were separate redirect links for bus and metro when searching for the ride code initially, or if the City Pass couldn't be used for Guiyang buses at all, it would be better. This feels like scamming tourists out of their ticket money.\nAdditional note: After topping up in the mini-program, you can use WeChat, but it even has a minimum top-up of 10 RMB, causing tourists to have to buy a metro card from the self-service machine when they're about to leave, which is really inconvenient.\nAnother addition: Some friends in the replies said that UnionPay can be used!

        "content": "Advice from experienced people: You must keep these in mind when choosing a quilt\nHow to select the right quilt can be a headache for those starting to live independently from their parents. Today, I’ll mainly share a guide on selecting quilts to help everyone find their ideal one! Common types of quilts include soybean quilts, synthetic fiber quilts, cotton quilts, wool quilts, down quilts, silk quilts, and so on.\n#SilkQuilt[topic]#\nSilk quilts are skin-friendly, similar to human skin, containing 18 amino acids that nourish the skin. They are elastic, static-free, and less likely to cause allergies.\n#SoybeanQuilt[topic]#\nFor comfort seekers, choose 100% pure cotton fabric with 20% to 25% soybean fiber content. It provides good warmth and breathability.\n#LongStapleCottonQuilt[topic]#\nIt’s fluffier, less prone to clumping, and warmer than regular cotton quilts. However, it’s not suitable for sponge cities or areas with persistent damp weather. Make sure to sun it frequently.\n#WoolQuilt[topic]#\nThis type of quilt is selective regarding users and environments. People allergic to fur should avoid it. It’s relatively expensive, and it’s not suitable for humid areas in the south as it tends to get thinner over time.\nSilk quilt from Canbo is my absolute favorite. I was quite torn while choosing it. After doing some research, I found that Canbo offers a pretty good option. The inspection opening is 80 cm long, and the quality of the silk is clear at a glance. Another reason for my choice is that their products are certified as premium grade according to national standards, ensuring quality. Even small details🤩, such as the snap buttons that protect the quilt cover, are well done👏👏. Plus, they even offer free refurbishing!\n#Quilt[topic]##QuiltRecommendation[topic]##HowToCleanSilkQuilts[topic]##QuiltForSleepingNaked[topic]##ChoosingAQuilt[topic]##BudgetQuiltRecommendation[topic]##SilkQuiltCare[topic]##BridalSilkQuilt[topic]##SilkQuilt[topic]##WeddingQuilt[topic]##Wedding[topic]##HomeTextileBedding[topic]##TongxiangSilkQuilt[topic]##HowToChooseSilkQuilt[topic]##TwoInOneMotherChildQuilt[topic]##ProductRecommendation[topic]##FourSeasonsUniversalMotherChildQuilt[topic]##SilkQuiltRecommendation[topic]##WeddingPrepGuide[topic]##WeddingPrepList[topic]##WeddingPrepProductSharing[topic]##CanboBrand[topic]##CanboSilkQuilt[topic]##Gifts[topic]##Girls[topic]##GiftIdeas[topic]##Wedding[topic]##DormitoryQuilt[topic]##ChildrensQuilt[topic]##SummerCoolingQuilt[topic]##SummerCoolingQuiltRecommendation[topic]##IsSilkQuiltWorthIt[topic]##WeddingPreparationGroup[topic]# #HowHeavyShouldDormQuiltBe[topic]# #WinterQuiltRecommendation[topic]# #WarmWinterQuiltRecommendation[topic]# #SilkQuiltRecommendation[topic]# #QuiltCoreRecommendationForDorm[topic]##SavingTips[topic]##DoubleEleven[topic]##LiJiaqiDoubleEleven2024[topic]##DoubleElevenPromotionTime2024[topic]##LiJiaqiDoubleElevenRedEnvelope[topic]#",

If you terminate the contract before two years, not only will there be a termination fee, but also high remaining construction fees.\n⭕️ Compared to Au light, the service target is Japanese citizens. Once Japanese people choose an internet provider, they rarely change it, so au does not have a network transfer service. Transferring with au not only requires paying the remaining construction fees of the old house but also the construction fees for the new house.\n⭕️ SoftBank light is more friendly to foreigners in Japan. SB light has a special promotion for network transfer. The network can move with the contract holder. During the use of SB light, if the contract holder moves, the network can be transferred for free at any time, with zero transfer fees, regardless of whether there is construction work at the new house, no fees will be incurred.\n🔅 Therefore, compared to this point, SB light is definitely the best choice.\nCurrent SB light promotions are as follows:\n✅ Free construction fees\n✅ Free initial setup fees\n✅ Free router\n✅ Free temporary wifi (only provided by SB among all Japanese internet companies, from the application date to having internet access, fastest in three to four days, slowest in five to six days.)\nFrom the application date, only a basic monthly fee of 4180 yen is deducted each month, with no other additional fees!

        "content": "Single article fee ranges from 300 to 5000💰 My 100 submission channels revealed\nIn 2020, my eldest child was born, and in April 2021, I quit my job with a post-tax salary of 20,000 due to no one helping to take care of the baby. Now, when I think about it, it has been nearly 4 years.\n\nDuring this time, my husband works in a new first-tier city and only comes home on holidays. My eldest child and I live in a second-tier city. Now, thanks to my efforts and discipline, I no longer need to go to work. I really enjoy this lifestyle of working freely during the day and taking care of the baby in the afternoon and evening.\n\nCurrently, my main sources of income include:\n\n1. Finance blogger: I have my own account and consistently produce content. I have gained some fame in my industry, which is my main source of income.\n\n2. Freelance writer: I accept commissioned articles from companies, with about 2500 words per article, and a fee of 5000 per article. I receive 2-3 such commissions every month.\n\n3. Self-media blogger: Although I don't have many followers yet, it still generates income.\n\nSo, if you are currently unemployed or a full-time mom, you can also consider following my path, using your skills to try and change your life.\n\nFirst, let's talk about writing. Emotional articles, opinion pieces, and hot-topic articles are all popular among readers and favored by major accounts. You can choose a niche you like, delve into it, and then submit your work or publish it on public platforms to earn fees or monetize directly.\n\nHere, I have summarized several commonly used article structures for the aforementioned niches, which are also frequently used by major accounts. Once you master these, you can try submitting your work for monetization.\n\n✅ Introduction:\n\nTV plot + life scene + famous quote/golden sentence + lead to the following text\nHot event + famous quote/golden sentence + insights + lead to the following text\n\n✅ Body:\n\nStory 1 + summary + Story 2 + summary (usually 2-3 stories)\nEvent + summary + positive case + summary + negative case + summary\n\n✅ Conclusion:\n\nSummarize the main point + famous quote/golden sentence + method\nEcho the previous text + famous quote/golden sentence + call to action\n\nFor specific articles, you can refer to the content of major accounts like Ten Point Reading, Fan Book, Ten Point Character, etc. Specific submission channels can be seen in the note images.\n\nIf you find this challenging, try Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book). The threshold is low, and the word count requirement is minimal. As long as you share sincerely and master the techniques, you can do well.\n\n📌 Here are some tips from my experience on Xiaohongshu:\n\n1. If you're not good at video editing, start with images and text. It's less challenging and easier to stick with.\n\n2. Combine your strengths and interests to find bloggers with similar skills, and imitate their topic selection, note structure, cover images, inner page images, and monetization methods.\n\n3. During note creation, incorporate more of your own experiences and insights. Don't obsess over literary talent; try to use plain language, as sincerity is the key.\n4. Niches like home, parenting, women's growth, health, workplace, beauty, etc., have high monetization potential. You can start with these.\n\n5. Embrace long-termism. Don't give up after posting a few articles with little response. It's normal for beginners to post more than a dozen articles before one takes off. One hit article is a matter of luck.#Don't Want to Work[Topic]# #Writing Tips[Topic]# #Submission[Topic]#",

In hindsight, it was a decision I regret. The hype is greater than the actual content, leaving me questioning my judgment.\n\n🐳 Not a Murder Mystery: Moreover, \"Catching Mistresses\" is not a murder mystery.

As one of the few teachers and mothers on the entire network who have taken their child through the complete study of all 6 volumes of the '4000 Words', I believe I am qualified to evaluate and share this set of books. Let's get started! 🎉🎉\n👩‍🏫 Things to know before studying '4000 Words':\n🔴 This set of books is very suitable for Chinese children to advance their English vocabulary and grammar, including intensive listening and reading training\n🟠 Among the six volumes, those that can bring the most qualitative breakthroughs to children's English learning, Teacher Tang believes, are from Volume 1 to Volume 2\n👓 Which children are suitable for Volume 1 and Volume 2 of '4000 Words'?\n🟠 Volume 1 is more suitable for children above 3rd or 4th grade with a vocabulary recognition of 800+\n🟢 Volume 2 is more suitable for children above 4th or 5th grade with a vocabulary recognition of 1200+\n📖 How to study '4000 Words':\n🎯 Step 1: Each unit contains 20 words, practice after learning the words\n🎯 Step 2: Place the learned words into short passages for intensive reading and translation practice\n🎯 Step 3: Complete reading comprehension questions in order\n⚠ Notes when learning words:\n🟠 Part of Speech: Always pay attention to the part of speech when learning new words, as many English words have more than one part of speech\n🔵 Phonetics: After learning phonetic knowledge, it must be applied in the process of learning words, through extensive deliberate practice to help children master it\n🟢 After-class passages: Passages must be intensively read and translated, so that after children learn the words, they know what methods to use and in what context to acquire them\n👩‍🏫 Teacher Tang's final words: Remember! Not memorizing words while learning them is cheating, not testing words after memorizing them is cheating, and not reviewing words after testing them is the ultimate form of cheating!\n#Shining Buyer[Topic]# #Memorize Words[Topic]# #Original English Textbooks[Topic]# #1000Words[Topic]# #2000Words[Topic]# #4000Words[Topic]# #New English Textbooks[Topic]# #Textbook Revision[Topic]# #New 7th Grade[Topic]# #Vocabulary Camp[Topic]#",

If I don’t have time to eat breakfast, I mix it with oatmeal as a meal replacement. At first, there was no noticeable change. When mixed with milk, it has a rich milky flavor and tastes great!\nI’ve been drinking one cup a day consistently. After nearly two months, I noticed a significant decrease in appetite, a slimmer waistline, and more frequent bathroom visits. After sticking with it for more than half a year, I really achieved freedom in dressing. I no longer worry about choosing clothes.\nWhen I first started buying cocoa powder, I realized it’s a tricky market. I’ve fallen victim to bad purchases a few times. Many friends around me want to try it but are hesitant to buy. I want to share the insights I’ve gathered with everyone. If you’re planning to drink cocoa powder, you should definitely read this:\nDrinking more cocoa powder doesn’t mean more absorption. Normally, 3-5g per serving once a day is sufficient.\nWhen choosing cocoa powder, remember this point: opt for pure raw cocoa powder ground at low temperatures; it provides a stronger sense of fullness, better appetite control, and is more effective for metabolism improvement.\nMoreover, safety certification for cocoa powder is very important. It's crucial to choose cocoa powder with safety certifications.\nIt feels like discussions about cocoa powder always include complaints about it being a 'waste of money' for three main reasons:\nIrregular consumption, like doing it inconsistently. Such usage will certainly be ineffective because it requires gradual, consistent effort.\nPeople who've never tried cocoa powder but jump on the bandwagon after hearing others say it doesn’t work.\nBuying poor-quality cocoa powder with bad taste and lots of additives. Getting easily persuaded without the ability to differentiate leads to useless purchases. Inferior products definitely don’t work.\n#CocoaPowder[Topic]##WeightLoss[Topic]##Metabolism[Topic]##MealReplacement[Topic]##Fullness[Topic]##DailyDiet[Topic]#",

Elevation design is then carried out based on this, enhancing the space's aesthetic value and emotional expression. Both are indispensable parts of interior design, and neither can be omitted. Therefore, we should not view the importance of flat and elevation design in isolation but should comprehensively consider the balance and integration of both according to specific design goals and needs to achieve the best design effect. #Every home deserves attention [topic]#",

Once approved, everyone can start practicing hours. The fastest way to complete Subject One hours is in three days, one day at the driving school, and the remaining two days at home. After completing the hours, it also needs to be reviewed, which usually takes two to three days, and then you can schedule the Subject One exam.\nFuzhou has many Subject One exam locations, you can schedule the one closest to you. Sometimes there are many people signing up, and it might be possible that you can't get a slot.\nSo there is plenty of time to study for Subject One after signing up.

        "content": "Motorcycle Trip - Peaceful Mountains and Seas, Recommended Motorcycle Route in Shandong Peninsula\nRiding Information:\n📅: July 2024\n⏰: 5 days and 5 nights\n🌡: 26~32°\n🛣️: 900 km\n🗺️: Huangdao → Laoshan → Rongcheng → Weihai → Yantai → Qingdao\n🏍: BMW R1200GS, Honda Africa Twin, T700\n🌡: 26~32°\n🥼: Revti Territory\n👖: Xiaodiaozhi (brand/person)\n👟: Alien Snail (brand/person)\n📷: iPhone 13 Pro\n🎥: GoPro7/Insta360 x2\n\n-\n\n[SmileR] Purpose of the Trip\nTo better enjoy this coastal motorcycle trip in Shandong Peninsula, experiencing local scenery, tasting local food, and so on, adjustments were made to the route and content, discarding the previous “rushing” travel mode. By saving time (transporting motorcycles by truck from Shanghai to Qingdao), the focus was on experiencing the most exciting segments, maintaining about 200 kilometers per day on average.\n\n[SmileR] Travel Approach:\nThe “Thousand-Mile Sea and Mountain Self-Drive Tourist Highway” basically runs through from Qingdao to Weihai. It is also officially recommended as a self-drive route. Hence, we followed this road for our Shandong Peninsula trip.\n-\n\n[SmileR] Day.0 Qingdao Huangdao\nArrival by high-speed train, vehicle pickup, accommodation, and planning details for the next day's trip.\n\n[SmileR] Day.1 Huangdao → Laoshan ☀️-⛅️\nThe Qingdao Beer Festival happened to start that day, but we passed by due to time constraints.\nNavigated along the coastal highway to Lian Island, then headed to @harbour cafe for a photo session before moving directly to Laoshan.\n\n⚠️ The Huangdao-to-Qingdao ferry service has been discontinued. The bridge and tunnel are off-limits to motorcycles, requiring a detour.\n⚠️ We stayed in Laoshan and were able to pass after informing and registering.\n⭐️ The cafe is located quite far inside; personally recommended.\n\n[SmileR] Day.2 Laoshan → Rongcheng Strong Winds-Heavy Rain\nExperienced national highways of large Shandong province and rested briefly at Silver Beach in Rushan.\n\n⚠️ Beware of crosswinds strong enough to topple trees\n⭐️ Roads are wide and scenic by the sea\n\n[SmileR] Day.3 Rongcheng → Weihai → Yangma Island → Yantai ☀️\nPersonally felt this was the most exciting road segment in Shandong Peninsula: fun, scenic, and sunny.\n\n⭐️ The Weihai section of the coastal highway features wind turbines on the left and the sea on the right, with two stranded ships fixed along the route;\n⭐️ Expect plenty of surprises along the coastline;\n⚠️ The Blue Whale shipwreck attracts many tourists and vehicles; safety is a must.\n⚠️ Yangma Island is beautiful but severely congested, with all two-wheelers stuck during peak times.\n\n[SmileR] Day.4 Yantai → Laiyang → Qingdao Heavy Rain-☀️\nRain here was intense enough to test any raincoat's waterproof rating, with standard raincoats offering minimal protection.\n\n⭐️ Stunning beach photoshoot location, especially post-rain, where the “Lonely Whale” resides;\n⭐️ Mountain roads and forest paths along inland national highways bore a striking resemblance to Lishui in Zhejiang province;\n⚠️ The viral wall in Yantai Hongkou Road is hard to locate.\n\n[SmileR] Day.5 End\nPacked the motorcycle for transport back to Shanghai, visited trendy restaurants, and bade farewell with Yantai’s signature heavy rain (nothing prevents getting drenched).\n\n⭐️ For Qingdao specialties, head to local wholesale markets for significant savings equivalent to a tank of fuel;\n⚠️ Even the best trendy restaurants can’t handle overcrowding, with slow service, small portions, and average flavors.\n\n-\n\n[SmileR] Summary\nCompared to Hainan, the region offers a better cost-performance ratio for eating, drinking, and entertainment.\nCompared to Fujian, it lacks diverse scenery but compensates with a unique northern vastness.\n\nOverall, for those who enjoy coastal motorcycle trips, the Shandong Peninsula is worth visiting at least once. If time allows, consider taking a ferry from Yantai to Dalian to continue the journey northward for an additional experience.\n\nDue to space limitations, only highlights are covered.

It was a waste of effort; there's simply no degree certificate!\nWhether it's for civil service exams, career development exams, or postgraduate exams, a degree certificate has become an essential requirement. Without it, you're not even eligible to register.\n\nEven in the workplace, without a degree certificate, the value of your education is significantly reduced. Without a degree certificate, all your efforts might be in vain!\n\nThe National Open University is an officially recognized pathway for academic advancement, and its academic records can be verified on the Xuexin website. But without a degree certificate, its value is almost zero.\n\nIn fact, many students at the National Open University find it difficult to obtain a degree certificate. What are the reasons behind this?\n\n👉 I've summarized a few main reasons:\n\n[Reason 1] Lack of preparation and understanding before enrolling in the National Open University, leading to blind registration.\nAlthough it seems easy to register at the National Open University without an entrance exam, the challenges arise after enrollment, including online courses, assignments, final exams, thesis preparation, defense, and submission of graduation materials.\n\nTherefore, before registering for the National Open University, make sure to clarify the requirements, such as whether offline final exams are needed, the expectations for online courses, thesis writing, whether a defense is necessary, and so on.\n\n[Reason 2] Issues with the selected institution.\nMany institutions do not actively inform students that they need to apply for a degree certificate, as it increases their workload and often yields little appreciation.\n\nSome institutions are actually intermediaries, only responsible for enrollment, with no understanding of the education administration team or backend delivery, resulting in many students failing to obtain a degree certificate. Thus, it's better to choose study centers for registration!\n\n[Reason 3] Ignorance of the requirements for applying for a degree certificate, realizing only at graduation that one is ineligible to apply.\n\nOnly by understanding the basic conditions for graduation can you apply for a degree certificate.\n\n👉 Application requirements include:\n1. A minimum average score of 75 points in required courses;\n2. A good grade (or 80 points or above) on the degree thesis;\n3. Passing any of the following foreign language exams with a qualifying score:\n(1) Bachelor's Degree English Exam of the National Open University;\n(2) Adult Bachelor's Degree English Exam;\n(3) Level 3 or above of the Public English Test System (PETS-3);\n(4) College English Test Band 4 or Band 6.\n\n#NationalOpenUniversity[Topics]# #DegreeCertificate[Topics]# #DegreeApplication[Topics]# #OpenUniversityEnrollment[Topics]# #AcademicAdvancement[Topics]#",

During this time, encourage the child to complete all necessary preparations, such as eating, drinking, using the restroom, and ensuring that stationery and books are neatly placed on the desk. Once in the learning state, stay seated and focus on the homework.\nStep 2: Knowledge Review Station (No review, no homework)\nEmphasize that 'sharpening the axe does not delay the cutting of wood', and let the child spend some time reviewing the day's learning content before starting homework. This not only deepens memory but also makes the homework process smoother, seemingly time-consuming but actually efficient in improving scores.\nStep 3: Timed Challenge Competition (Timed homework)\nIntroduce the concept of 'timed challenge competition', using a timer to set reasonable time limits for each homework task. Let the child treat homework with an exam mindset, without flipping through books or asking others, especially when encountering difficult problems, encourage independent thinking, and wait until everything is completed before asking questions in a centralized manner.\nStep 4: Detective Prodigy (Checking and prompting)\nAdjust checking strategies flexibly for children of different ages. For lower-grade children, provide more specific error prompt ranges; for higher-grade children, appropriately relax to cultivate their self-checking ability. Through gamification, let the child become a 'detective prodigy' in finding errors.\nStep 5: Treasure Vault of Mistakes (Frequent use of mistake notebook)\nEstablish a 'treasure vault of mistakes', guiding the child to record mistakes from each homework session. This is not just a process of collecting errors, but a valuable resource for accumulating knowledge and avoiding repeated mistakes. Regularly review the mistake notebook to make the learning path more solid.\nStep 6: Emotion Manager (Three no-principles for parental emotions)\nAs a parent, play the role of an 'emotion manager' well, following the 'three no' principles: no urging, no nagging, no judging.

They are particularly suitable as family pets, especially very friendly towards children. Golden Retrievers are highly intelligent and have strong learning abilities, making them relatively easy to train, and are often used as guide dogs, rescue dogs, and other working dogs. Their elegant appearance and soft, smooth fur also make them very popular in terms of looks.\n\nHowever, Golden Retrievers also have some drawbacks. Firstly, they shed a lot, especially during molting seasons, requiring regular grooming to reduce shedding and maintain fur health. Secondly, Golden Retrievers are prone to certain genetic diseases, such as hip dysplasia, elbow joint issues, and some heart diseases. Therefore, when choosing a Golden Retriever, it is essential to select a reputable pet store and ensure the dog has a good health check record. Golden Retrievers also need a lot of exercise and mental **, otherwise they may exhibit destructive behavior or become anxious. Their large appetite also requires extra attention to diet management.\n\nOverall, Golden Retrievers are a very suitable breed for family life #GoldenRetriever[Topic]# #ColdKnowledgeAboutGoldenRetriever[Topic]# #GoldenRetriever[Topic]#",

        "query": "Does middle school physics tutoring need to be supplemented?",
        "content": "I have taught middle school for 7 years, and this year I am teaching grade seven. Here’s a heartbreaking truth: when you enter middle school, you'll find that for many average students, spending money on tutoring is wasted. Parents think it’s the teacher's problem, so they frequently change teachers, but in the end, they discover that the grades still don't improve. In fact, tutoring only shows real results when the ability is improved. Otherwise, it’s just temporary, with fluctuating grades that lack stability.\nMany teachers describe average students as \"half-full bottles making noise.\" Why is this? Because compared to top students, they completely lack the following five abilities! Without these, no matter how much tutoring they receive, their scores won’t improve!\n\n[1R] High emphasis on basic concepts and fundamental principles. For subjects like math and physics, basic concepts and principles are very important. Many average students don't value them, which leads to difficulty in problem-solving. They often get stuck, choose incorrect answers in multiple-choice questions, and can't fully solve complex problems—just a few steps at most. A lack of basic concepts and principles is a sign of poor logical thinking because concepts and principles are like the bricks and tiles of logical thinking. Without them, how can you build a house?\n\n[2R] Rigorous problem-solving process in math, physics, and chemistry. Top students have their modes of solving problems, relying on their accuracy in calculations and speed. Their logical thought chains are complete, ensuring no marks are lost on basic problems. Conversely, average students often rush into writing without clear thinking, skip steps in calculations, or prefer mental math. Hence, they frequently get stuck on medium-difficulty problems, fail to secure marks on basic questions, and struggle with difficult problems. Ineffective studying can be worse than not studying, and the same applies to tutoring.\n\n[3R] Excellent time management skills. Top students plan their daily tasks, allocate time reasonably, and aim for maximum productivity with the time spent, making them highly efficient. The biggest difference between them and average students is homework. Average students lack time management and are always overwhelmed with assignments, exhausted, and have no time to review their weaknesses. Due to staying up late completing homework, their health deteriorates, making them drowsy during classes and forcing them to stay up late again to catch up.\n\n[4R] Ability to review and reflect. Top students review every valuable point they encounter. Reflection involves accurately summarizing and comparing their results with standard answers. If there are mistakes, they will continue reviewing until they fully grasp the material. They may not say it aloud, but they will silently rehearse it in their minds. This ability is not easily noticeable but is a common skill among top students.\n\n[5R] Summarization and classification ability. Top students place high importance on their mistakes. The ultimate purpose of practice is to identify weaknesses. Mistakes are valuable resources. Categorizing and organizing these mistakes can significantly improve learning quality.\n\n#Grades[Topic]##Mathematics[Topic]# #NewGradeSeven[Topic]# #MathematicalThinking[Topic]#",

Central Radiant Layout: With a central display area as the core, other display areas are distributed around this core.

Free Layout: There is no strict fixed route for display areas, and visitors can freely choose their visiting paths. This layout is more flexible, giving visitors more autonomy, but may require some guiding signs to help them better understand the exhibition content.\n4. Unit Layout: The exhibition hall is divided into several relatively independent units, each with a specific theme or display content. This layout allows visitors to focus on specific themes and facilitates the organization and management of the exhibition.\nDifferent layout types are suitable for different types of exhibition halls and content.

        "query": "Do dry skin types need to use cleansing masks?",
        "content": "An article explaining the essentials of skincare for dry skin (pure practical tips!!!)\nAs a dry skin individual myself🙋, dry skin may have fewer concerns with oiliness and acne but ages very easily!!!\nSo be sure to put in extra effort for skincare! Here are some valuable insights from my personal experience, shared for all my fellow dry skin sisters👭. May we all move closer to having normal skin!\n\n1️⃣ Dry skin doesn't need to use a facial cleanser every day.\nAnyone advocating that dry skin needs to cleanse morning and night, or even use cleansing devices, is either ignorant or malicious!! Dry skin naturally has insufficient oil production; the skin surface doesn't accumulate much dirt. Even using amino acid-based cleansers twice a day might harm the skin barrier, making it even drier. Use water in the morning and a cleanser in the evening for cleansing. If you don't wear makeup or use sunscreen, you can simply wash your face with water and use a cleanser every 2-3 days. However, I still recommend wearing sunscreen daily!\n\n2️⃣ Beware of face mask traps\nThe truth: excessive use of face masks can lead to hydration-related skin issues, making the skin increasingly sensitive. Ask any dry-skinned individuals who use face masks daily—have they turned their skin into normal skin? Dry skin should not overly rely on face masks for hydration, as such hydration is often temporary. In general, sheet masks are effective in specific cases like flaky skin, all-nighters, seasonal changes, aesthetic enhancements, etc. Use no more than two masks per week regularly!\n\n3️⃣ A highly moisturizing face cream is a must-have for every dry skin individual.\nDry skin can go without everything else, but never without a well-moisturizing face cream. A good face cream is the lifeline for dry skin!!\n\n4️⃣ Face oils are excellent but should be used sparingly\nExtremely dry skin should pay attention to face oils, as they are more skin-compatible and offer stronger occlusive properties. A simple trick is to add a few drops of oil to your face cream. But do not overdo it by using excessive oil or slathering yourself in oil—it may backfire by making your already idle sebaceous glands even more reluctant to work.\n\n5️⃣ Be cautious of dryness lines on your face! Prevent them from becoming real wrinkles\nDry skin is highly prone to fine lines caused by dryness. Such lines can be addressed with serums containing hyaluronic acid, B5, or urea combined with occlusive moisturizing creams to fade them effectively. However, if left unmanaged, these can deepen into dermal wrinkles, making them much harder to treat.\n\n6️⃣ Dry skin often appears dull—address it with supplements for vitality, anti-glycation, and antioxidants\nFor dull complexion, check for liver function and blood circulation issues first. Reduce sugar intake in your diet and focus on antioxidants in your skincare routine. Although this step may seem subtle, it greatly helps improve dull complexion while preventing free radicals from causing havoc on your skin, leading to more severe problems.\n\nSummary⬇️\nRemember this formula: Moderate cleansing + Focused hydration + Scientific anti-aging. You're not far from turning your dry desert skin into an oasis👌\n#DrySkinCareTips [Topic]# #SkinCareSharing [Topic]# #Skincare [Topic]# #SkincareTips [Topic]# #BeginnerSkincare [Topic]# #DrySkin [Topic]#",

Complete one set every two days and circle unfamiliar words).\n3️⃣ Listening materials (used to train your ear; listening accounts for a large proportion of the score and is very important)\n4️⃣ Test-taking strategies (CET-4 has many strategies; learning them before doing exercises can double efficiency).\n⚠️ Note: Memorizing vocabulary daily is a must. It's normal not to remember everything on the first pass; being able to think of the Chinese meaning when seeing the English word is enough.\n-\n2. Which teachers' classes to follow\nListening section: Follow listening techniques from \"Roasted Duck TV\" on B Station.\nReading section: Methods from \"Jie Binbin,\" which are quick and effective.\nTranslation section: Methods from \"Respect,\" using the book \"An Overview of Chinese Culture.\"\nParagraph matching: \"Respect,\" very helpful.\nWriting section: Templates from \"Wild Goose\" or \"Respect.\"\n-\n3.

        "content": "Bought expired waterproof coating in a specialty store\nOne kitchen and two bathrooms, only one wet area. Since it's the second floor of a villa, although it's up to the seventh floor, the second floor is a backwater layer, worried about falling into the waterproof pit. Found the only specialty store in the area through the Yuhong public account. Bought a barrel of g101, g103, j90. Who would have thought it almost went wrong. g101 and g103 were researched before, and all over the building materials market are flexible 200 and 100s, the more expensive ones are nowhere to be seen, but with underfloor heating hoping for better extensibility. The specialty store had stock after a phone call, and out of trust, I didn't think about expiration when buying, and also took a barrel of j90 wall solidifier. After getting home, I found that the executive standard of j90 was not 907-2018, and the tile worker was in a hurry to contact the store to exchange goods the next day, at half past eight in the evening. Exchanged for a barrel of j102, the VOC content was reduced by 40g/l, feeling very happy. After getting home, I glanced at the production date and found it had expired for half a year. The other two barrels of waterproofing were also in this situation. Returned the three barrels of materials the next morning. Called all the waterproof merchants on Baidu Maps before barely buying a barrel of new packaging g101, a barrel of 100s, j100 and above are not available in the market, switched brands and bought a barrel of Meichao 500 wall solidifier.",

What are the unrestricted majors?\nCan the college-to-university program in Shanghai switch majors?\nIf there are major restrictions, you cannot switch, but you can apply to schools that do not restrict majors.\nIn the annual admissions plans of various institutions in Shanghai, there are always some college-to-university programs that do not restrict related majors. Among them, public schools account for a small portion, while private schools account for a larger portion.\nWhen applying to these majors, we need to pay attention to:\n1. Pre-application conditions\nAlthough some schools do not restrict related majors, there are still prerequisites such as English CET-4 and computer level 1 requirements, and some minor language majors may have additional certificate requirements;\nMany students may encounter a situation where the major studied in college does not have a corresponding college-to-university institution. In this case, if you want to pursue a college-to-university program, you can only prepare for the exam by switching majors.\n2. Knowing the restrictions\nIf there are no restrictions on related major applications, the number of applicants is usually large, making the competition relatively intense. When preparing for these majors, applicants must not take the preparation lightly.\nFor example: East China University of Political Science and Law—Law major in 2024 has 12 admissions, with 192 applicants; Shanghai University of Political Science and Law—Chinese Language and Literature major in 2024 has 20 admissions, with 227 applicants; Shanghai Lixin University of Accounting and Finance—Finance major in 2024 has 26 admissions, with 101 applicants, etc.\nThe above image shows the summary of unrestricted major applications for the college-to-university program in Shanghai in 2024:\nFor students applying across majors, we need to start studying as early as possible to grasp and master the new subject knowledge comprehensively, so that we can stand out among other applicants and successfully get admitted to our desired undergraduate institutions.\n#Can college-to-university programs switch majors [topic]##Cross-major exams [topic]##College-to-university program [topic]##Information gap [topic]##Shanghai college-to-university [topic]#",

        "content": "Does 1.5T even deserve to be called a Tiguan?\nIt's been over a month since I got it back. Let's talk about the space first. The rear seat of the previous Golf was quite cramped, and my family wasn't comfortable sitting in it. Now, this Tiguan is really spacious. The power is not an issue; if you're willing to step on it, it's there. The fuel consumption is less than 8 liters per day. After all, the car body is heavy and the wind resistance is a bit more. The previous Golf Traveler, with the same commuting route, had a long-term fuel consumption display of 6.9. Both cars have the same power of 118 hp, 160 horsepower, Golf torque 240, Tiguan torque 250. The difference is that the Golf uses a dry dual-clutch, which shifts faster and has less wear and tear. Although the Tiguan uses a wet dual-clutch, which is said to have a lower failure rate, the shift speed is noticeably slower. Moreover, the 1.5T engine needs about 85 km/h to switch to 7th gear on flat roads, probably to maintain the highest torque platform for better power response. If you manually switch to 7th gear at 75 km/h, it can still drive normally, but it feels a bit underpowered. The 330 or 380 doesn't have this issue, considering the starting price difference is 50,000 yuan. Overall, it's very good for family use. The base model comes with enough features: automatic headlights, automatic wipers, electric tailgate, which used to be optional extras. The low fuel consumption of the small displacement is more suitable for workers. If you have the money, just go for the 380 without thinking. #Tiguan[Topic]# #Volkswagen[Topic]#",

(UK and Europe)\nA friend who graduated with a bachelor's from Tianjin University and a master's from Shanghai Jiao Tong University applied for a PhD under a prominent figure in the UK and was invited to share his experience on applying for a PhD from a domestic master's program.\nTaking his familiarity with European and UK university PhD applications as an example, domestic master's applicants need to accumulate achievements in four areas: academic performance, language proficiency, research outcomes, and other preparations.\n1. Academic Performance (GPA)\nA good GPA is a prerequisite for securing a good project, which might differ from what most people think.\nCertainly, PhD interviews mainly assess the candidate's research potential, but often your competitors may not have strong paper publications. For instance, in the UK, one-year master's programs focus on coursework, and many applicants for PhD programs have not undergone complete research training, hence lacking significant outcomes. In such cases, GPA becomes a crucial reference, at least indicating the candidate's foundational knowledge, learning ability, and attitude. A good GPA can leave a great first impression on the supervisor.\nMy friend, during the mass application phase, connected with a rising star at a European university in a field completely unfamiliar to me. I was quite surprised when the professor invited me for an interview and couldn't help but ask why he gave me this opportunity. He said he noticed my high GPA and strong background, and even if the research direction wasn't a perfect match, he believed I could learn it. Since then, I realized that the higher the GPA, the better.\n2. Language Proficiency\nAlmost all universities clearly state their English proficiency requirements on their websites. From a pragmatic standpoint, meeting these standards is sufficient.\nSpecific communication skills can be improved with diligent practice in an English-speaking environment.\n3. Research Outcomes\nHaving published papers is a significant advantage during application.\nAs mentioned earlier, UK master's programs focus on coursework, making it difficult to publish high-level papers. Some people might resort to various means to include one or two papers on their resume. However, domestic master's students, guided by supervisors and with longer study periods, can achieve notable academic results if lucky. With such qualifications, applying for overseas PhD programs becomes much easier.\n4. Other Preparations\nAdditional materials needed include resumes, cover letters, recommendation letters, and research proposals (RP). Once these are ready, you can start targeted mass applications.\nCertainly, connections can further help secure suitable projects, including recommendations from domestic supervisors, self-introductions at academic conferences, and actively seeking collaborations with prominent figures. Such opportunities should be firmly grasped.\nIf you find this useful, please like, collect, and follow. More notes on overseas PhD scholarship applications will be shared later.\n#Contemporary Scholars [Topic]# #Contemporary University Students [Topic]# #Postgraduates [Topic]# #PhD [Topic]# #Master's [Topic]# #Domestic Master's [Topic]# #PhD Application [Topic]# #Overseas PhD Application [Topic]# #Overseas PhD Application [Topic]# #Pursuing a PhD [Topic]# #UK [Topic]# #Europe [Topic]# #Overseas PhD [Topic]#",

Here are the main procedures and points to note for sending GRE scores:\n\n◻️ Free score sending on test day:\nAfter the test, if you are satisfied with the unofficial Verbal and Quantitative scores, you can choose to send the scores immediately for free to up to four schools. You can choose to send the scores from this test (Score Select Most Recent) or all GRE test scores from the past five years (Score Select All).\n\n◻️ Paid score sending after the test:\nIf you need to send scores to more than four schools or did not choose to send scores on the test day, you can pay to send scores after the test through the ETS website. The fee for sending scores is $35 per school.\n\n◻️ Methods of score sending:\nThe most common way is to send scores online via the ETS website. Alternatively, you can request score reports to be mailed or faxed, but these methods are more cumbersome and time-consuming.\n\n◻️ Steps for sending scores:\n🔹 Log in to the ETS website and go to \"My GRE Home.\"\n🔹 Click \"Send Additional Score Reports.\"\n🔹 Verify your personal information and select the schools and scores to send.\n🔹 Confirm the information is correct and proceed with payment.\n\n◻️ Payment methods:\nThe fee for sending scores must be paid with a credit card in USD, and domestic credit cards need to have international payment functionality enabled.\n\n◻️ Score sending time:\nETS takes about 5 business days to process score-sending requests, and mailing times vary by destination. It is recommended to complete score sending at least two weeks before the application deadline.\n\n◻️ Score validity:\nFor tests taken on or after July 1, 2016, scores are valid for five years from the test date.\n\n◻️ Score reinstatement:\nIf you canceled your scores at the end of the test, you can request to reinstate them within 60 days after the test date, which costs $50.\n\n◻️ Contact the schools:\nIf you are unable to send scores in time before the application deadline, you should contact the schools promptly. Some schools may offer a grace period.\n\n◻️ Confirm receipt of scores:\nAfter sending scores, it is recommended to check with the schools to confirm whether they have received the scores.\n\n-\nFor those who want to learn more 📩\n\n#GRE[topic]# #gre[topic]# #GRETest[topic]# #GREPreparation[topic]# #grePurePhysics[topic]# #greHomeTest[topic]# #GREReform[topic]##GREQuestions[topic]# #GREMath[topic]##greReform[topic]#",

        "content": "Friends, when buying an electric bike, be sure to ask for a full invoice.\nThis month, I bought a small Fenda at a Tailing offline store in Chengdu, and they only gave me a receipt. I asked for an invoice at the time, and they gave me one for 800 yuan. I noticed the amount was wrong and asked the boss about it. He said the invoice was just for getting a license plate, and the amount didn't matter. I felt there was something wrong with his explanation, but I didn't say much and let him handle the license plate. He said he needed my certificate of conformity, receipt, and invoice to proceed, so I left these documents with him.\n\nA few days later, when I went to pick up the license plate, I found that the invoice was missing. I asked the boss for the invoice, and he directly told me that the vehicle management office had used it for the license plate. I said he could just download and send me an electronic version. At the time, I accepted the 800 yuan invoice. Then the boss gave me a very bad attitude and lectured me, yes, he lectured me, saying that the invoice had been used and was no longer useful, and why was I making such a fuss. I got angry and insisted that he must issue me an invoice. Later, someone from the store came over to mediate and asked me to send a message to their after-sales service on WeChat. He sent a voice message in front of me asking to issue the invoice and even took a photo of my message interface. Seeing his attitude was okay, I left, asking him to send an electronic version. However, for the next few days, there was no response to my messages, and I got very angry, feeling like I was being treated like Hello Kitty. I directly called Tailing's official phone to ask if they never issue invoices for car purchases and only make cars, not chargers (because he gave me an Aima charger, claiming Tailing chargers were unavailable). The customer service asked for the store's phone number to check the situation. Less than 10 minutes later, the WeChat replied, but after a long discussion, they still didn't issue the invoice.\n\nAt 12 PM, they called to say the Tailing charger was back and asked me to come exchange it. I went at 3 PM and again asked for the invoice. The mediator said, 'Oh, they still haven't issued your invoice? How could this be?' I directly asked if it could be done today. He said it definitely could. I asked how long it would take. He said before 6 PM. I knew he was bluffing again and asked if I had to wait there until it was done. Seeing my determination, he finally took me to his Aima store to issue the invoice. The woman handling the invoice had a bad attitude too, but I didn't indulge her either, maintaining a stern face and cold voice. Finally, I got the full invoice and left.\n\nFriends, asking for an invoice when buying things is a legitimate right. It is evidence of the legitimate source of our purchased products and a civic duty to pay taxes. Don't feel embarrassed or be swayed by the boss's words. Insist on our rightful claims. Moreover, if you buy insurance for your vehicle, the compensation is based on the invoice amount. When you buy a car in the future, you also need to check the invoice.\n#Electric Bike [Topic]##Invoice [Topic]# #Car Buying Matters [Topic]##Chengdu [Topic]#",

Essential Balm\nMost people are familiar with essential balm. Apply it to the glue mark and ensure it is fully soaked for 15 minutes, then wipe it off with a towel to remove the glue mark. However, this method is only suitable for small areas of glue residue.\n2. Glue Remover\nFor large areas of glue residue, a glue remover is necessary.

The first two times were just day trips, so I had some basic concepts about the distribution of Beijing's scenic spots. Our first destination was to watch the flag-raising ceremony, so we wanted to choose a very convenient location.\n\n[Two R]: The hotel is located on Qianmen Street, which means it takes about 15-20 minutes to walk to Tiananmen Square. We arrived in Beijing late at night, so we could walk there after dropping off our luggage, which was really convenient.\n\n[Three R]: Nearby, we found Sijiminfu, a Beijing hot pot restaurant we wanted to try, and local specialties were available on Dazhalan Pedestrian Street. We also liked the taste-testing at Daoxiangcun, so we bought some. Basically, it took about 5-10 minutes to walk back to the hotel after meals.\n\n[Four R]: How to get to the hotel by taxi:\n1⃣️ You can navigate to the I exit of Qianmen Street Subway Station (10 minutes walk) or to the A northwest exit of Zhushikou Subway Station (8 minutes walk). The taxi fare to Daxing Airport was 120 yuan.\n\n[Five R]: The transportation in Beijing really relies on the subway, but it can be tiring because many subway exits require a lot of stairs. Sometimes seeing girls carrying luggage is exhausting. So our initial plan was to avoid changing hotels to save time, as we had many places to visit and needed to wake up at 6:00 AM, leaving at 8:00 AM and returning at 9:00 PM.\n\n[Six R]: We were three girls staying together for 5 nights, with a total cost of 500-600 yuan per night. Initially, we booked a double room, but thankfully the front desk upgraded us to a family room, which was more comfortable. Initially, we were somewhat dissatisfied with the dim lighting and slow heating of the air conditioner, but the convenience of the location, food, and transportation made it worthwhile.\n\n[Seven R]: The I exit of Qianmen Street can directly take a bus to Badaling Great Wall or Mutianyu Great Wall, which are popular tourist spots. The area is very safe, with armed police stationed at the hotel entrance.\n\n[Eight R]: All the above are real feelings, and there are many hotels in the vicinity.

Here's a summary of the test drive and ride for everyone (I personally lean towards the Touareg L a bit), because I'm planning to get it.\nThe most obvious aspect is the size. The Tiguan L is less than 4.6 meters long, looking like a compact SUV. Although it is positioned as a mid-size SUV, it is clearly not as authentic as the Touareg L. The Touareg L is over 4.7 meters long, with a longer wheelbase than the Tiguan L, approaching 2.8 meters. The rear seat space is indeed larger than that of the Tiguan L, making it convenient for taking parents and children out later. It is truly the king of cost-performance among joint-venture SUVs.\nFurthermore, the Touareg L itself has a very high entry-level configuration, with features like a sensor tailgate and electric closure, and 12-way electric adjustment for both the driver and passenger seats. The Tiguan L's entry-level model does not have a sensor tailgate, and the passenger seat only has 8-way electric adjustment, which shows the gap. Inside the Touareg L, there is also a 12-inch central control screen, equipped with an advanced adaptive cruise control system with automatic start-stop and collision warning system with automatic braking, making it the best choice for those who often drive on highways. For me, it's like icing on the cake.\nIf it weren't for my need for 2.0T power, I might have chosen the Touareg L's 300TSI version. It is equipped with Volkswagen's new 1.5T EVO II efficient engine, with a fuel consumption of only 6.6L per 100 kilometers, even lower than the Tiguan L with the same engine. Both cars can use 92-octane gasoline, costing just over 0.5 yuan per kilometer, which is really economical. I chose the 2.0T version, which also comes with the R-Line sports package and newly replaced 19-inch R-Line aluminum alloy precision wheels, looking very stylish.\nNot long ago, the Touareg L was ranked first in customer satisfaction among mid-size SUVs over 200,000 yuan, showing its strong capabilities. Now, the 2024 model of the Touareg L starts at 169,900 yuan, and it also comes with up to 5 years of 0% interest policy, which really tempts me. The 330 version I test-drove was extremely easy to drive, with a lightweight steering wheel, precise direction, and linear brake and throttle, making it easy for anyone who can drive to master it. It is indeed the top choice among 200,000-level SUVs, truly impressive.",

Based on my experience living in the house for over a year, I've summarized 18 small tips↑ that can be referenced during kitchen design, for your reference only [smiling face with horns R]~\n[check-in R] Choice of high and low countertops: High and low countertops are more humanized, but the size design of high and low countertops should be calculated based on the person who often cooks\n[check-in R] Choice of cabinet doors: With a lot of kitchen fumes, high-gloss cabinet doors are easier to clean\n[check-in R] Choice of countertops: Quartz stone countertops are easier to manage, have higher hardness, and are less prone to staining\n[check-in R] Choice of sliding doors: Floor-track sliding doors are more stable, and now there are minimalist tracks that are both aesthetic and practical\n[check-in R] Choice of cabinet handles: Full handles are more simple and beautiful\n[check-in R] Choice of cabinet panels: Solid wood multi-layer panels for cabinet bodies have strong nail-holding power and better load-bearing capacity\n[check-in R] About water barriers: Designs without water barriers are simpler, but water barriers can create hygiene dead corners\n[check-in R] Integrated stoves vs. separate stoves: Integrated stoves require changes to the flue and are expensive, while separate stoves have more brand and style options, transparent prices, and are more practical\n[check-in R] Choice of sink: Large single sinks are more practical\n[check-in R] Light strips: Adding a light strip to the cabinet can avoid the obstruction of light by the hanging cabinet\nUndermount sink vs. overmount sink: Undermount sinks are easier to clean and less prone to mold\n[check-in R] Choice of sockets: Avoid using track sockets as they are greasy and difficult to handle; use sockets with switches, which are easier to clean\n#Renovation[topic]# #DIY Renovation[topic]# #Renovation Diary[topic]# #Kitchen[topic]# #Kitchen Renovation[topic]# #Kitchen Renovation Inspiration[topic]#",

        "content": "Personal experience post for the nth visit to the National Museum\nNever enough to explore, simply not enough haha, some tips to avoid pitfalls for everyone's reference:\n[Fairy R] Transportation: The subway is the most convenient, exit at Tian'anmen East Station and you're at the museum entrance, taxis are not allowed to stop nearby no matter how you navigate, need to walk about 700m\n[Fairy R] Reservation: Search “National Museum” on WeChat public account, tickets for 7 days later are released at 5 PM every day, basically first-come-first-served, you can reserve other time slots first to input your ID information, so the operation is faster when grabbing, occasionally there will be scattered tickets available so keep refreshing\n[Fairy R] If you really can't get a ticket: [Peach R] search for the National Museum, there are 15 RMB tickets available from travel agencies, personally tested and they work for entry\nKey points!! Avoid pitfalls [Knife R]\n1. Reservation & entry are time-specific! Morning session tickets are not valid in the afternoon, same for the afternoon session\n2. Do not wear slippers, you will be stopped and not allowed to enter\n3. No hot water inside the museum (there are hot drinks in the 2nd-floor cafe), no hot food, only biscuits and bread are available on the B1 floor\n4. Entry stops at 4 PM, clearing starts at 4:30 PM (no entry to zoned exhibitions), the museum closes at 5 PM\n5. Ancient China is on the B1 floor, covering all eras and dynasties before the Ming and Qing dynasties, a thorough visit takes about 2h, there are many exits for crowd dispersion in the middle, if you accidentally exit before finishing the Ming and Qing sections, you can return to continue exploring\n6. Priority to take the subway/bike when leaving the National Museum, taxis are not available in that area\n\n[Fairy R] Hidden route:\nThe National Museum is connected to Tian'anmen Square, no reservation needed, after visiting the museum, walk straight across the traffic lights to the square, the square and Tian'anmen are also connected, there is an underground passage at the flag-raising platform, which leads to the opposite side for a close view of Tian'anmen\nFeel free to leave comments if you have more questions",

Sweatshirts and shirts in Barcelona and Madrid, slightly hot in the south, dresses and short sleeves are fine\n\nDAY1: Beijing✈️Barcelona\n\nDAY2-3: Barcelona\nIf you have good stamina, you can walk to almost all attractions (except for caramel mountain sunset, which requires a taxi round trip). Bought a T-familiar 8-ride ticket for two people with some left over.\n\nDAY4: Barcelona🚄Granada\nStayed too short in Granada, but one afternoon and evening were enough to visit Granada Cathedral, Nicolas Viewpoint, and Alhambra Palace. The entire town is walkable.\n\nDAY5: Granada🚗Nerja🚗Malaga\nStarted the road trip from Granada, heading south to the small town of nerja. Spent a leisurely day by the sea and drove to Malaga in the evening. Relaxed for two hours on Malaga beach, enjoying a stunning pink mist sea sunset.\n\nDAY6-7: Malaga🚗Seville\nBirthplace of Picasso, and attractions are very concentrated, accessible on foot. The old town is great for wandering. Drove to Seville in the evening.\n\nDAY7-8: Seville\nEnd of the road trip, and the whole city is walkable. Two days are enough for exploring and eating. Buying a combined ticket for two cathedrals avoids queues. Make sure to arrive early at the palace as there's a queue to enter. You can row a boat at Plaza de España for 6 pounds/boat for 35 minutes. The most suitable city for leisurely city walks throughout the trip.\n\nDAY9: Seville🚄Madrid\nStayed too short in Madrid, only had one day to visit Retiro Park and go shopping. The only slight mishap was planning to go to the supermarket on the last day to buy ham and other specialties but found the supermarket closed on Sunday! Be sure to plan your time. Skipped other attractions, leaving small regrets for the next visit!\n\nDAY10: Madrid✈️Beijing\n\n✨Personally, I like the Andalusia region the most. It has a completely different style from Catalonia and Madrid, instantly immersing you in the Mediterranean and Arab vibes, the intersection of Catholic and Islamic civilizations. I love this dazzling array of vivid colors and architecture. The overall itinerary is not exhausting because I wanted to take it chill. So I spent more time in the seaside towns and Seville. Time in Granada and Madrid was slightly less, and it would have been more leisurely to travel with a longer holiday.\n\n#Spain[Tag]#  #Barcelona[Tag]# #Granada[Tag]# #HiddenTravelDestinations[Tag]#  #Malaga[Tag]# #Seville[Tag]# #SpainTravel[Tag]# #EuropeTravel[Tag]# #SceneryOnTheRoad[Tag]# #FreeTravel[Tag]#",
