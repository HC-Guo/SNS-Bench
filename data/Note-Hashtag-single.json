[TulipR]\n[RainbowR] My understanding of minor cosmetic surgery has undergone a deep sublimation during the training. Skin, like a wordless book, silently records our lives, dietary habits, and even mental trajectories. Through further education, I increasingly feel that every care for the skin is a respect and cherish for life itself.\n[CelebrateR] While navigating the ocean of knowledge, I learned how to tailor appropriate care plans based on different skin types; facing skin issues such as spots, acne scars, and wrinkles, I also mastered professional strategies and techniques.\n[FireworksR] Every detail in the training is like a carefully carved pearl, connecting the trajectory of my growth. From the delicacy of professional techniques, to the use of beauty equipment, to the heart-to-heart communication with clients, I learned how to listen to their needs and expectations with a professional attitude and warm words. These seemingly trivial details are the indispensable cornerstone of building quality service.\n[CherryBlossomR] Now, looking back on this journey, I am filled with gratitude. I am grateful to have had such a valuable opportunity for further education, and I look forward to turning what I have learned and realized into practical actions in the days to come, bringing beauty and confidence to more people. I will continue to explore and move forward in the field of minor cosmetic surgery, constantly improving my professional level and service quality, contributing my part to this hopeful industry.",

Choosing the Right Popular Cat Food for Weight Gain, Not the Expensive Ones!\n    Note Content: Heartfelt advice, it's better not to blindly buy cat food. There are many cat foods on the market, and I've bought a lot of popular cat foods. I found that cat food is not necessarily better the more expensive it is, especially some domestic cat foods have really surprised me. Without further ado, let me share my tips on choosing cat food, hoping to help everyone!\n1⃣ Cat Food Ingredients List\n✅ High in fresh meat, high in nutrition\n✅ Less meat meal is better, as it's not high in nutritional value\n✅ Try to avoid grains, as cats have delicate stomachs and digest poorly\n2⃣ Detailed Meat Types\n✅ Chicken, duck, and beef are poultry proteins, easier for cats to digest and absorb nutrients\n✅ Duck meat is warm in nature, to some extent it can reduce cats' tear stains, a sign of heatiness\n✅ Other less common meats depend on the cat's acceptance\n3⃣ Nutritional Components\n✅ Optimal range: 35%≤crude protein≤45%, too high can cause digestion issues, too low lacks nutrition\n✅ Crude fat around 14%-20%, for overweight and senior cats, choose 16% and below\n4⃣ Different Needs, Different Choices\n🐱 Weak cats: Choose cat food high in fresh meat and quality protein to help cats gain weight\n🐱 Cats with hair loss, dry fur: Choose cat food containing fish oil\n🐱 Picky eaters: Choose cat food with good palatability\n🐱 Overweight cats: Choose low-carb, low-fat, low-phosphorus cat food\n🐱 Cats with poor digestion: Choose cat food with probiotics\n🙋 Simply sharing some cat foods I usually feed, for your reference!\n➡️ MMCO: Promotes weight gain and cheek development\n➡️ Huanxin: Nourishes the stomach and promotes weight gain\n➡️ Xianlang: Nutritious and palatable\n➡️ Penet: Crispy texture",

Maybe it's the act of buying that makes me happy [Thumbs Up R]\n\n[Right Arrow R] Eye Drops [Right Arrow R] After comprehensive use, Hailu and artificial tear type eye drops are the most effective, non-irritating and additive-free. Use them if you have dryness, very comfortable. They can also be used with steam eye masks or cold eye patches. However, for people with high myopia or high intraocular pressure, hot compresses are not suitable, better to use cold patches.\n\n[Right Arrow R] Printer [Right Arrow R] You need to print a lot of materials for the postgraduate entrance exam, buying a color printer can greatly enhance happiness and save a lot of time. Although I also use iPad for notes, I later felt that writing and drawing on paper materials feels better.\n\n[Right Arrow R] Eye Care Pills [Right Arrow R] I did a lot of research on Xiaohongshu, and finally bought Youyisi Blueberry Eye Care Pills. Recently there's an upgrade, I want to try this Obsidian Eye Care Tablet. After taking them, my eyes are indeed less dry. I've also tried Doppelherz, but the effect doesn't seem as good as Youyisi.\n\n[Right Arrow R] Fish Oil [Right Arrow R] WHC Xiaoqianjin and Jinkaiser are considered the best fish oil brands, I've tried both and they're good. However, Xiaoqianjin adds 1000iu of Vitamin D, if you don't plan to supplement Vitamin D separately, you can choose this.\n\n[Right Arrow R] Vitamin D [Right Arrow R] Lack of Vitamin D can cause many small issues. We don't often get sun exposure, most of us lack Vitamin D. A previous hospital check showed severe deficiency, I take the Sun Bottle brand.\n\n[Right Arrow R] Lumbar Support and Ergonomic Chair [Right Arrow R] I have to say, a good chair really makes a difference. It's super comfortable to sit in, can improve my focus. Everyone can do some research, choose one that suits you or a lumbar support.\n\n[Right Arrow R] Study Tools [Right Arrow R] A4 paper plus loose-leaf notebook plus hole punch, the perfect study combo. I also bought various colorful pens, but these are just auxiliary tools. Studying shouldn't be about formalism, it should really stick in your brain! Also, having a planner that suits you can help you complete review tasks step by step, reducing anxiety.\n\n[Right Arrow R] Coffee [Right Arrow R] I've tried almost all brands on the market, the ones I drink the most are Santunban and Mokona No. 8 and No. 10, good taste. You can buy some sample packs on platforms first, see which one suits your taste better.\n\n[Right Arrow R] Tablet [Right Arrow R] The tablet is a relatively important study tool for me, I bought the iPad Pro 12.9 inches, not too big, I even think it's small. It's very convenient for reading or anything, without carrying heavy books.\n\nAlright, that's all I can think of for now. If anyone has any questions or wants recommendations, feel free to leave a comment [Thumbs Up R]",

The eldest child developed eczema after being born, and after going to the hospital, the doctor suspected it was an allergy and wanted to test for allergens. The family disagreed with drawing blood at such a young age, so it was eventually dropped; they started avoiding certain foods, eating only rice, pork, and vegetables every day, but the eczema persisted, and eventually they just let it be, applying medication diligently until it naturally subsided after a few months.\n2. The second child followed the same path as the eldest, developing eczema after birth. This time, without going to the hospital, they directly used two ointments, Compound Polymyxin B and Dineide, applying them one hour apart twice a day; within five days, the eczema subsided.\n3. I was considering online consultation when I stumbled upon a fellow mother's consultation experience, which really opened my eyes, and I want to share it to reduce anxiety;\n4. Our family has no history of allergies; the gold standard for diagnosing allergies is the avoidance and provocation method, as advised by a director at the provincial women's and children's hospital during the eldest's allergy consultation. Eczema is a process that cannot be completely cured, but it improves as the child grows, provided there are no symptoms like vomiting, abdominal pain, or abnormal growth.",

Helping others as much as possible...\n    Note Content: The weather in Hulunbuir from June to August is beautiful and very suitable for traveling\nSummarized some experiences and lessons as a reference for everyone. I hope the sisters who are about to go to Hulunbuir can avoid pitfalls in time!!!\n-\n[Travel Tips]\n🔸When is the best time to go ❓❓\nRight now❗❗When we went, the grass was already green, with a gentle and beautiful color. It's not too cold or hot, and there are no mosquitoes 🦟 yet. Also, it gets more expensive over time. This month is still considered the off-season\n🔸What's the temperature like ❓❓\nIt can get up to around 23°C at noon, but it's much cooler in the morning and evening. You need long sleeves and pants, and a jacket if you're coming now\n🔸Is it a self-driving trip ❓❓\nNo, self-driving is not recommended. Mobile phones often lose signal when deep in the grassland. We hired a local guide with a car package, including play and accommodation. The guide was super nice, always introducing us to his hometown, leading us through many beautiful and lesser-known routes, and we didn't have to make our own itinerary, which was awesome\n🔸What to prepare ❓❓\nSunglasses, hats, sunscreen, telephoto lens, beautiful clothes and dresses\n🔸What about the food ❓❓\nMeat, meat, meat! In Inner Mongolia, every meal must have meat—roast lamb ribs, Russian-style skewers, barbecue, braised beef ribs, beef meatball soup, Russian cuisine. The restaurants recommended by the guide were all fantastic and absolutely delicious\n-\n[Travel Itinerary]\n🔸𝐃𝐚𝐲1: Hailar Meetup ➠ Dragon Searching Shooting Location ➠ Morigele River ➠ Erguna Wetland\n🔸𝐃𝐚𝐲2: Dali Mountain ➠ Marmot Park ➠ Birch Forest ➠ Aoluguya Reindeer Park ➠ Longyan Mountain\n🔸𝐃𝐚𝐲3: Forest Sightseeing Train ➠ Fairy Slope ➠ Enhe Russian Ethnic Village\n🔸𝐃𝐚𝐲4: Enhe Back Mountain ➠ Smile River ➠ Peony Hill ➠ Heishantou (Horse Riding) ➠ Nomadic Household (Feeding Lambs, Go-Karting)\n🔸𝐃𝐚𝐲5: 186 Colorful Grass Skating ➠ Mammoth Park ➠ Matryoshka Doll Scenic Area - Night Tour in Manzhouli\n🔸𝐃𝐚𝐲6: Manzhouli ➠ Windmill Mountain ➠ Genghis Khan's Tethering Post ➠ Return to Hailar\n-\n[Travel Tips]\n🔸The temperature difference between morning and evening is large, so it's recommended to bring a thick jacket. For photos, it's suggested to wear white or bright colors as they stand out more\n🔸Once you enter the grassland, the signal often drops. Self-driving is not recommended. Hire a reliable car package guide for a relaxing, worry-free, and enjoyable trip\n🔸With summer vacation approaching, Hulunbuir is also entering the peak travel season. It's advised to book local resources early to avoid price hikes during the peak season",

It won't have any negative impact on you!!\n-\n⚠️In what situations can you submit an EC?\n1⃣ Unable to complete your essay or assignment and can't meet the deadline; applying for an EC extension to get extra time\n2⃣ Not prepared for the exam, feeling sure you'll fail and don't want to retake for just a passing grade; submitting an EC application gives you a chance to retake with no upper limit on grades\n3⃣ Already in a retake situation, still feeling you'll fail, and after failing again, you won't have another exam opportunity, meaning you can't graduate; EC application grants an additional retake opportunity\n4⃣ Late submission of essays (e.g., missed the deadline due to poor internet speed), don't want to get penalized with point deduction/zero grade leading to failure; applying for EC waives the penalty. \n-\nIf you don’t know how to apply for an extension, don’t hold on and struggle by yourself.

        "content": "Note Title: 30+ Late Marriage, Discussing How Happy Marrying the Right Person Can Be\n    Note Content: My husband went on a business trip to Russia for an industry exhibition. He flew for more than ten hours and landed in Moscow yesterday. At around midnight, I received his WeChat message: 'Dear, sleep early. My longing for you spans across the Siberian tundra. I miss you so much~'\n\t\nMy husband is good at saying gentle and cute things. I am 32 years old this year. I met him when I was 29, three years younger than me. I married him in my early 30s, and we now have a 1-year-old child. He is like a little sun, healing my fear of marriage that stemmed from coming from a single-parent family. After marriage, he proved through his actions that a home can indeed be a warm harbor. Even with late marriage, as long as you marry the right person, feeling loved and cherished brings happiness every day, making life worth looking forward to daily.\n\t\nHe is emotionally stable, easygoing, and optimistic. Although younger than me, I tend to get impulsive and anxious when faced with problems. His wise words are always: 'Being anxious is useless. Just solve the problem. Don’t worry, I’m here for you.' He has the ability to make me feel calm and at ease no matter how big the issue is.\n\t\nHe loves his wife and child, putting family first. As a child, he dreamed of growing up quickly to get married—done. He dreamed of having a daughter—done. He is content and happy, and as soon as he gets off work, he eagerly goes home to spend time with me and our daughter, displaying some clingy traits.\n\t\nWe grow together, respecting and supporting each other. He explains English grammar I don't understand and helps resolve worldly issues I tend to overthink. No matter how strange my ideas are, he helps analyze the pros and cons while respecting my decisions.\n\t\nHe is compassionate and kind-hearted. He keeps cat and dog food in his car. Last year, he rescued an injured and bleeding kitten from the roadside. He spent thousands of yuan and stayed with it for two days, but unfortunately, it didn’t survive the critical period and passed away. He was very sad and said he hoped that in its next life, the kitten could live happily.\n\t\nHe pays attention to details and is thoughtful and gentle. He remembers my preferences and dislikes. On trips, birthdays, anniversaries, or any day with a sense of ritual, I always receive thoughtfully selected gifts from him. Even after work, he would bring home an orange for me to taste.\n\t\nAs a visual person, I suggested changes to his glasses and hairstyle. He doesn’t know much about fashion, so he willingly wears what I pick for him. At 185cm tall and well-proportioned in physique, even a casual makeover exceeds my expectations of handsomeness. He often expresses heartfelt gratitude: 'Thank you for taking care of my looks, dear. You’ve worked hard. It’s so good to have you.'\n\t\nHe truly has numerous virtues. On any standard, he holds himself to high standards but never forces me to keep pace with him. In our marriage, both of us express ourselves freely while offering mutual understanding and support, growing and achieving together.\n\t\nBecause he is such a great person, he influenced me to want to become a better person too. Both of us aim to improve, giving each other a higher-quality life partner as a return gift. Marrying him is truly my fortune. The heavens have been gracious to me, granting me such an amazing husband.\n\t\nMarrying the right person brings true happiness. Even for late marriages and for older-age unions, as long as you find the right one, it’s okay to be a little late…",

If you prefer self-learning, then understanding the underlying logic of soft decoration design is the first step. Next, I will tell you about the learning process of soft decoration design, making it easy for you to get started!\n\n🌱First Stage: Understanding the Underlying Logic of Soft Decoration Design\n\nBefore diving deep into the study, you first need to have a comprehensive understanding of soft decoration. Ensure you are familiar with the core elements and basic principles of soft decoration design, so that you can better grasp the direction of subsequent learning.\n\n🌈Second Stage: Mastering Styles and Colors\n\nSoft decoration design cannot be separated from the combination of styles and colors. You need to establish your own style system and have a clear understanding and knowledge of various design styles. At the same time, master the basic principles and rules of color matching, learn to combine theoretical knowledge with practical cases, and enhance your design level.\n\n📋Third Stage: Understanding Soft Decoration Products\n\nThere are many types of soft decoration products, and you need to have a basic understanding of various products. Knowing different styles, materials, and purposes of soft decoration products will help you better choose and match in the design process.\n\n🚀Fourth Stage: Advanced Learning\n\nAt this stage, you need to deeply study the rules, dimensions, software operations, and other knowledge of soft decoration design. Also, understand aspects such as lighting, feng shui, marketing negotiation, budget quotation, etc., to enhance your comprehensive abilities and professional qualities.\n\n📖Fifth Stage: Case Study and Reference\n\nIn learning soft decoration design, case study is a very important part. You can improve your design level by viewing various completed space cases, soft decoration magazines, and master soft decoration cases. Draw on the excellent designs of others, combine your own ideas and creativity, and gradually form your own design style.\n\n🔥Sixth Stage: Practical Exercises\n\nThe final step is practical operation. You can try to create soft decoration plans, present plan reports, and convey your design concepts to clients. During the project implementation process, pay attention to communication and collaboration with factories, suppliers, and other parties to ensure the smooth completion of the project.\n                \nIf you are interested in soft decoration design, you can give me a thumbs up!\nShijiazhuang City, Tangshan City, Qinhuangdao City, Handan City, Xingtai City, Baoding City, Zhangjiakou City, Chengde City, Cangzhou City, Langfang City, Hengshui City",

Xingwan.\"\n\n\"Ten million.\"\nXu Suijie held Mu Xingwan's hand that wanted to bet on his mouth. \"I bet, Xu family of Jiangcheng.\"\n\n[2]\nAt the engagement ceremony, Xu Suijie and Mu Xingwan were even more praised by the media as a perfect match, a talented man and a beautiful woman.\nBut with their previous quarrelsome relationship, there were always people who couldn't stand it and spoke ill of them.\n\n\"I said it, they have no feelings, this marriage might just fall apart anytime.\"\n\"Mu Xingwan is too spoiled, she even dares to show her face in this kind of situation.\"\n\nAs a result, the young master chased her all over the banquet hall, \"Don't be angry with me, okay.\"\nMu Xingwan was still reluctant, \"Not angry anymore.\" \"Really?\"\n\"You're so annoying, it's true, really.\"\n\nEveryone had an expression of being stuffed, okay, okay, we know, you are really together.[3]\nLater, the Mu family and the Xu family suddenly dissolved their marriage alliance. People in the circle didn't know the truth, which led to countless speculations.\n\nAt first, a few brothers were still worried about the young master.\nBut the young master returned to being single and seemed to be extremely carefree. He probably let it go.\n\nHalf a year later.\n\nMu Xingwan returned to the public eye.\nJust when everyone thought she was going to marry into the Ji family this time, Xu Suijie started chasing her again.\nSeveral brothers expressed that they couldn't understand this move.\n\n\"You don't even understand this.\" Xu Suijie looked annoyed, \"It's just that I'm chasing my wife to the crematorium.\"\n\n--Xu Suijie: I've liked you for a long time, it's a fact. That's why I proposed the marriage alliance, and I was afraid you wouldn't agree, so I lied a lot, there's no such thing as inheriting the family business.\n--Xu Suijie: When you agreed to the marriage, I was really happy, but I didn't dare to show it.\n--Xu Suijie: There were some things I couldn't tell you in high school, and after the marriage, I always thought that life is so long...

It's likely due to a weak spleen.\n.\nA weak spleen easily leads to internal heat, making skin pores open and susceptible to colds, and causing constipation due to dried-up stool moisture.\nThus, addressing spleen weakness requires both clearing and replenishing.\n.\nMonday: Morning/Evening Porridge: Hawthorn and Yam Porridge, benefits spleen and aids digestion. Soup: Radish and Cabbage Soup with Dried Scallop, nourishes yin and clears heat.\nTuesday: Morning/Evening Porridge: Yam, Purple Rice, and Red Date Porridge, strengthens spleen and Qi. Soup: Cabbage and Tofu Soup, clears heat and moistens intestines.\nWednesday: Morning/Evening Porridge: Millet and Raisin Porridge, boosts Qi and benefits spleen and kidneys. Soup: Lotus Root and Lily Bean Juice, nourishes yin and clears heat, soothes heart.\nThursday: Morning/Evening Porridge: Chestnut and Lily Porridge, replenishes Qi, moistens lungs, and nourishes heart. Soup: Codonopsis and Lotus Seed Soup, strengthens spleen and Qi, nourishes yin and clears heart.\nFriday: Morning/Evening Porridge: Peanut and Red Date Porridge, strengthens spleen and stomach, enriches blood and calms spirit. Soup: Pear and Lotus Root Soup, benefits spleen and stomach, clears heat and nourishes yin.\n.\nThese combinations balance clearing and replenishing, especially vital in dry winter.

I quickly compiled some good ones, fearing that you might step on a mine by accident!!! Don't be lazy and save trouble!! If you want to get one, take a look at this post~----How to Make Primer More Adherent:  1. Cleanse the Skin: Use a mild cleanser to thoroughly clean your face, ensuring the skin is clean and free of residue.  2. Basic Skincare: Before applying the primer, perform basic skincare routines, such as using toner and lotion.  3. Apply Moderately: Take an appropriate amount of primer and evenly apply it to the facial skin, avoiding excessive use to prevent a heavy feeling.  4. Local Concealing: If needed, use additional concealer products to cover obvious blemishes.  5. Setting Makeup: Depending on the need, use loose powder or setting spray to set the makeup, keeping it long-lasting.---  CPB Primer---Fine and Adherent  Jialan Duting Primer---Concealing and Brightening  Ermutao Primer---Evening Out Dullness  Aolailey Primer---Nourishing and Brightening  Defei Primer---Sunscreen and Adherent  Bobbi Brown Primer---Hydrating and Nourishing------    ＃Aolailey Primer  ＃Recommended Primer for Dry Skin＃Foundation Makeup",

My husband is from Kunming and works in Huizhou. Naturally, we moved into this house together after marriage. Now I'm pregnant, and my husband suggests we get a bigger house, selling this one. The issue is this house is my pre-marital personal property. After changing houses, the current house prices have dropped, and the new house would be marital property, which isn't cost-effective. I want to ask how can I ensure the house remains my personal property?\n\t\n\n[Like R][Like R]【Dao Hua Marriage and Family Lawyer's Advice】\n\t\n\nBased on the lawyer's years of experience, here are several solutions to share with everyone:\n\t\n\n[One R] When selling the house, you can open an independent bank card and make all expenses related to the house sale through this card. Deposit the proceeds from the house sale into this card, and also use this card for purchasing the new house. Keep all transfer records and contracts properly to avoid mixing assets. Meanwhile, do not deposit other income into this card to ensure the source of funds for buying the house is clear and definite, thus guaranteeing the new property still belongs to your personal property.\n\t\n\nSome say the money from selling the house isn't enough to buy a new one, what to do?\n\t\n\n[Two R] For instance, if you get 1 million from selling the house but still need 500,000 for the new one, you can ask your parents for this 500,000. Then, have your parents write a gift contract indicating this money is a personal gift to the child, unrelated to the spouse. Keep the transfer records and contract well. This way, the money in the card is pre-marital personal property.\n\t\n\nAt this point, use all the money to buy a house. The transaction records can prove this house was purchased with pre-marital personal property, registered solely under your name, hence the newly purchased property after marriage still remains your personal property.\n\t\n\nFollow @Dao Hua Marriage and Family Lawyer Team, specializing in major property-related marriage and family disputes [Raise Hand R]",

While the scenery in Tibet is stunning, it's still recommended to prepare thoroughly before traveling! Otherwise, you might encounter major pitfalls, especially during peak season! Here's a summary of a Tibet travel tips guide for those who need it! Feel free to save it!\n✅ Tibet Live Update:\n🌤️ Temperature: July temperatures range from 12°C to 22°C\n👗 Clothing: Be sure to bring a down jacket and a fleece coat (temperature differences are significant due to altitude)\n🧥 Outfits: Flat shoes, windbreakers/down jackets/thick coats + hats + scarves + sunglasses + leggings\n🏔️ Attractions: Most are sacred mountains and holy lakes. You can start with low-altitude places like Linzhi Suosong Village to acclimate to the plateau environment before visiting high-altitude attractions such as Yamdrok Lake or Mount Everest.\n😮‍💨 Honest Tips About Tibet:\n1. Do not attempt to climb the Potala Palace on the first day; you will surely experience altitude sickness.\n2. Always carry your ID. You need it to enter Barkhor Street.\n3. Avoid taking unofficial cars near bus stations or airports; you might get overcharged.\n4. One-liter oxygen bottles can be ordered as takeout in Lhasa at 15 yuan per bottle, with discounts available.\n5. Do not find carpool companions randomly on Xiaohongshu; there are too many uncertainties.\n6. Make sure to bring windbreakers/thick clothes, as temperatures vary greatly between morning and night or between mountains and valleys.\n7. Avoid choosing travel agencies with licenses from other regions; intermediaries will inflate the costs.\n8. Examine the itinerary carefully before booking a tour. Itineraries with too many or too few attractions are not recommended.\n9. Do not trust low-priced tours; you may be handed over to unqualified agencies.\n10. If possible, opt for small private tours or car hires instead of bus groups! Choose small private tours/car hires for comfortable seven-seater transportation with flexible stops to enjoy stunning views~\n🌴 Check-in Attractions\nNamtso: One of Tibet's three sacred lakes, absolutely beautiful scenery\nYamdrok Yumtso: One of the three sacred lakes, known as the plateau sapphire\nPotala Palace: A must-visit in Tibet, featured on the 50 RMB bill\nMount Everest Base Camp: Photo opportunity with the 8848 stone tablet, witness Mount Everest's golden sunrise\nMount Namjagbarwa: Nine out of ten miss it, the most beautiful peak\nYarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon: The world's largest canyon, with views of the most beautiful peak",

Which Children's Growing-up Formula is Best for Your Family?\n    Note Content: 🙋🏻‍♀ Recently, many new moms around me keep asking how to choose the right children's growing-up formula for their kids.\nActually, I think rather than looking at those random recommendations,\n👉🏻 it's better for us to do more homework. That way, we won't be in a panic when choosing children's growing-up formula!\n👏🏻 I've summarized the tips for everyone! Come and take notes!\n⭕ How to Choose High-quality Children's Growing-up Formula for Your Kids\n✨ Look at the Milk Source\nThe milk source is the foundation of high-quality formula. Prioritize choosing golden milk source regions such as Spain, Denmark, Ireland, France, Australia, etc.\n✨ Look at the Nutritional Ingredients\nAdded basic fortified formulas include CBP, calcium, protein, vitamins, etc. Different formulas have different enhanced ingredients, so choose according to your child's different physique.\n✨ Check the Ingredient List\nIt's best to choose formulas free from ingredients like sucrose, maltodextrin, and other unnecessary additives.\n👩🏻‍🏫 Lastly, I’ll share four children's growing-up formulas we’ve used. You can choose them with confidence~\n1⃣ E-goat Crown Goat Milk Powder - Suitable for kids who need a growth boost\n2⃣ Wyeth Ultimate - Suitable for kids just starting kindergarten\n3⃣ Biostime - Suitable for kids with sensitive stomachs\n4⃣ Abbott PediaSure - Suitable for kids who don't like eating\n🥰 My child is the kind who doesn't stand out much in class, so I give her E-goat Crown goat milk powder. It's enriched with hydrolyzed egg yolk powder, CBP, and other nutrients, specifically designed for kids like ours who need a growth boost. It has a lovely milky aroma, and my child especially loves it. With its individual packaging, she can easily bring it to school herself✌🏻~",

It is a type of bacteria that can survive in low-temperature environments (refrigerator). Listeria is a foodborne pathogen that can be transmitted to humans through contaminated food.\n🔴The harm of Listeria to the human body\nMost healthy adults may only experience mild symptoms or be asymptomatic after being infected with Listeria, but for the following groups, Listeria infection can be very serious, even fatal!\n🔴Symptoms of Listeriosis\nSymptoms of Listeria infection usually appear within a few days to weeks after consuming contaminated food. Symptoms vary depending on the severity of the infection and the health status of the infected person, including:\n📌Mild symptoms: fever, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.\n📌Severe symptoms: headache, neck stiffness, confusion, loss of balance, seizures (especially if the infection spreads to the central nervous system).\n📌Pregnant women: may only show mild flu-like symptoms, but the impact on the fetus can be very serious, leading to miscarriage, stillbirth, or neonatal infection.\n-\n🔴Methods to prevent Listeria infection\nTo reduce the risk of Listeria infection, the following preventive measures can be taken:\n🥗Food safety:\n①Avoid consuming undercooked or unpasteurized dairy products.\n②Ensure food is thoroughly cooked, especially meat, poultry, and seafood.\n③Store leftover food and cooked food in the refrigerator, but thoroughly reheat before consumption.\n🙎Personal hygiene:\n①Wash hands frequently before and after handling food and after using the toilet.\n②Avoid cross-contamination by using different cutting boards and knives for raw and cooked food.\n-\n📢Especially for households with pregnant women, babies, and the elderly, long-term disinfection of the refrigerator interior is essential when storing fruits and supplementary food! ❌If you only clean surface stains or odors without deep disinfection, no matter how much you clean, it's just deceiving yourself.\nRecommend everyone to use —— (1 disinfection effective for 10 days) which truly liberates housewives' hands!\n-\nWhy choose BACOBAN?\n✅ German quality \"BACOBAN\" nano anti-virus coating agent\n✅ Effectively kills E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, novel coronavirus, Listeria, Salmonella, etc.\n✅ Easy to use: just spray and wipe with a clean cloth, the interior surface of the refrigerator will be coated with a nano anti-bacterial layer, which will work to kill bacteria when they breed\n✅ One cleaning, effective for 10 days\n✅ Food industry disinfection certification, safe for refrigerator disinfection\n✅ Mild and non-irritating smell, non-corrosive, safe for direct contact with food surfaces\n✅ Sterilization + deodorization, a clean refrigerator, full of security❤\nLet's keep our refrigerators clean and healthy together, safeguarding our family's health!",

As of now, the new film 'Spicy and Scalding' remains firmly at the top of the box office, and she has become an idol of admiration for many and a favorite of major brands.\nMoreover, the outfits Jia Ling wore in these photoshoots were all sponsored by a top luxury brand, including the outfits she wore during previous roadshows, which also came from the generous support of this luxury brand. However, the average price of the accessories exceeded ten thousand yuan, and even these sets of clothing were off-season ready-to-wear, very likely to be the first wear in the domestic entertainment industry.\nBesides Jia Ling's outfits, the most attention-grabbing item during the roadshow was the watch she wore. Compared to her top luxury attire, this watch had a vintage feel. Later, insiders revealed that this watch was actually a keepsake from Jia Ling's mother. Jia Ling had it specially restored during the filming of 'Hello, Li Huanying,' and there was even a blogger who documented the whole heartwarming process. After learning this detail, many netizens were moved to tears by Jia Ling's actions.\nWhether before or after losing weight, Jia Ling has always been a star with extremely high national popularity, which stems from her confidence, self-love, and self-improvement.

Personally, I feel the saltiness is just right, quite authentic. I am quite picky and get stomachaches from noodles with a strong flavoring taste[FacepalmR].\nThe topping of this noodle doesn't use heavy seasoning for braising, which is very friendly for those with fragile stomachs after drinking, and the broth poured in won't make the instant noodles too soft![ThumbsUpR] Those who like chewy noodles can give it a try, the braised beef is also brisket, with a 60/40 fat-to-lean ratio, just right, you can taste that the bosses have put effort into making the dishes～[SmirkR]\nLastly, the service attitude of the young man is also super good, my friend loves green onions and coriander, so the young man put a lot, making my friend very happy.[GrinR]\n\t\nNext time after drinking, I will come back to try other flavors of noodles or rice, babies who are hungry after drinking at INS New Paradise can go and try, it will definitely be a surprise.[ThumbsUpR][ThumbsUpR][ThumbsUpR]",

Airfare alone costs 1500, and adding lodging and food, total expenses must stay within 4000; otherwise, all the effort won't be worth the cost (Many girls share rooms, stay in hostels, or directly sleep at the airport, eating nothing but instant noodles they bring from home for 4.5 days. I admire that, but I can't do it)\n3⃣️Safety is absolutely important‼️ I'm afraid of bad guys doing something in busy areas without anyone noticing. I can't accept small motels that have been modified with thin partitions, wooden doors without security features, poor soundproofing, and all kinds of people. A firm no❌\n\t\nIn summary, it's basically 🈚️ to find a place under 300 that meets these 3 requirements. Adding some budget improves the environment significantly. Since I stayed at this place, I've been in love.\nAdvantages and Disadvantages:\n[1R] Excellent location, right at the Chungmuro subway station Exit 6. As soon as you step out, you're there. The subway elevator goes straight up, very convenient for not wanting to drag luggage under the sun.\n[2R] Downstairs, there's a 24-hour GS25 convenience store (with Chinese-speaking staff), a Starbucks, BHC fried chicken, and Olive Tong within 300 meters. The basement even has a 24-hour unmanned salad bar (healthy meals). It's a 15-minute walk to Myeongdong, or just one subway stop if you don't want to walk.\n[3R] Although there are dozens of rooms on one floor, the soundproofing is decent. I didn't hear any noise, even from the corridor. Check-in is self-service on the first floor with a code. No need to interact with hotel staff. Socially anxious people, no worries. You can store luggage on the B2 level when you check out, and the staff's service attitude is pretty good~\n[4R] I didn't experience unstable water temperature during showers as mentioned in other reviews; it was relatively stable. The downside is there's no toothbrush, so you need to bring your own.\n[5R] The mattress is firm but very comfortable to sleep on. The two pillows have just the right firmness levels.\n[6R] Hotel facilities are complete: microwave, washer-dryer combo, refrigerator, TV, underfloor heating, and electric kettle—all available. The fridge is spacious and can freeze items, not the typical small fridge.\n[7R] Overall cleanliness is excellent. No visible dust or buildup.\n\t[MoneyR] Checked recently, and the price has risen to over 600. But last time I went in February, it was [MoneyR] 450/night. Price hikes during tourism seasons are understandable, but the environment here is indeed excellent.\n[ViewR] Many people also recommend Erin. However, their place feels a bit dated. I recommend this one more. Besides, U5, G3, and K9 are closer to Myeongdong, but I find them a bit noisy at night. With many tourists from various countries, I don't feel safe.\nHope this sharing helps everyone.",

Each component is carefully designed to provide a smooth and free-flowing path for the turbocharger.\t\n\nThirdly, the restrictive stock 73mm diameter intake pipe has been replaced by our larger 94mm diameter intake pipe. The filter itself has an outer diameter of 192mm (approximately 7.5 inches), with a filtration area exceeding 110000 mm^2.\t\n\nFourthly, our patented Venturi tube housing is designed to provide the maximum internal space for the S3 engine bay and to provide laminar flow for the turbo tube.\nFinally, the pipe seals the filter opening to the front panel, but is not limited by the stock intake.

When life is not smooth, blame the family of origin; when the workplace is not going well, blame the villains; when life is not successful, blame bad luck.

Below, I will share some advice based on subject difficulty and personal experience, hoping to help those of you preparing for the exam.\n.\n ✨ Personal Factor Analysis\n1⃣️ Full-time Preparation: If you have ample time, a solid foundation, and strong willpower, then 5-6 subjects await your conquest!\n2⃣️ Working While Preparing: If you need to balance work and study, have a foundation, and are disciplined, then 3-4 subjects are a good choice!\n3⃣️ Zero Foundation Preparation: If you don't have much learning foundation, need to strengthen your willpower, and have limited preparation time, then it's advisable to start with 2 subjects, steady and sure!\n.\n 👿 Talking About Study Resources\n🔺 The original questions mentioned by sisters are what I think are the most important and useful, mock exam questions can cover more than 80% of the exam points, needing repeated pondering\n🔺 Also, practicing questions is key, especially subjective questions, mastering scoring techniques\n✅︎︎ Suddenly found a place for CPA subjective question intensive practice book (paperback with free shipping), now you can still rush!\nI used a 👿 little orange app called [CPA Study Library] to get it, those who feel they don't have good resources for preparation can also give it a try\n.\n ✨ Subject Combination Suggestions\nGeneral Candidates: Recommend 3+3 or 2+2+2 mode, this can avoid slacking off when preparing for a single subject, and won't feel overwhelmed by leaving the hardest subjects to the end! 📚\n.\n ✨ Subject Connections and Combinations\nAccounting: As the cornerstone of CPA, highly related to auditing and tax law, it's recommended to prioritize! 🏛️\nFinance Management and Strategy: These two are the golden partners in exam preparation, one hard and one easy, complementing each other perfectly! 💡\n.\n ✨ Difficulty Characteristics of Each Subject\nAccounting: Extremely comprehensive, lots of content, focusing on understanding, high difficulty, but once you master it, other subjects are a breeze!\nAuditing: Large volume of content, abstract and obscure, but don't be afraid, use mind maps to help, understand and memorize, you can also become an auditing expert!\nFinance Management: So many formulas it can make your head spin, but once you understand the principles, practice more, speed and accuracy will soar!\nTax Law: Fragmented knowledge points, but memory is key, the three major taxes are tested every year, mastering them means you're halfway there!\nEconomic Law: Less calculation, more memory, strong preparation techniques, as long as you're willing to put in the effort, this subject is relatively easy to conquer! 📚\nStrategy: Broad content, flexible, but the textbook is the thinnest among all subjects, understand and memorize, the pass rate is also very high!\n\nWish everyone a smooth preparation and an early success! 🎊 Remember, every step of effort brings you closer to your goal.

My husband is from Kunming and works in Huizhou. After marriage, we naturally moved into this house together. Now I'm pregnant, and my husband suggested we get a bigger house, selling this one. The issue is that this house is my pre-marital personal property. After I change houses, the current house prices have fallen, and the new house would be marital property, which isn't cost-effective. I want to ask how can I ensure the house remains my personal property?\n\t\n\n[Like R][Like R]【Dao Hua Marriage and Family Lawyer's Advice】\n\t\n\nBased on the lawyer's years of experience, here are a few solutions to share with everyone:\n\t\n\n[One R] When selling the house, you can open an independent bank card and conduct all expenses related to the house sale through this card. Deposit the proceeds from the house sale into this card, and also use this card for purchasing the new house. Keep all transfer records and contracts properly to avoid mixing assets. Also, do not deposit other income into this card to ensure the source of funds for buying the house is clear and definite, thus ensuring the new property still belongs to your personal property.\n\t\n\nSome people say they don't have enough money from selling their house to buy a new one, what should they do?\n\t\n\n[Two R] For example, if you get 1 million from selling the house but still need 500,000 to buy a new one, you can ask your parents for this 500,000. Then, have your parents write a gift contract indicating that this money is a personal gift to the child, unrelated to the spouse. Keep the transfer records and contract properly. This way, the money in the card is pre-marital personal property.\n\t\n\nAt this point, use all the money to buy a house. The transaction records can then prove that this house was purchased with pre-marital personal property, registered only under your name, so the other property purchased after marriage still remains your personal property.\n\t\n\nFollow @Dao Hua Marriage and Family Lawyer Team, focusing on major property-related marriage and family disputes [Raise Hand R]",

        "content": "Note Title: Advise to all interns, be cautious during your internship...\n    Note Content:     1. Be cautious and alert when dealing with matters outside. Don’t disclose everything when someone asks something. Keep some reservations. Don’t naively think someone cares about you just because they call you cute and sweet~ They might only want to pry information from you. You can never truly know someone's intentions;\n[FireR]\n2. Mentally, you need to be stronger. Rest whenever you can. During the internship period, don’t overly care about the opinions of your mentor. Our goal is to successfully complete the internship and get the certificate. If this place isn’t suitable for you, there will be other places that are. Learn to improve yourself;\n[FireR]\n3. If other teaching mentors need your help with something, always inform your primary mentor. Let them know in person, and if not possible, call them. Don’t just go without saying a word, especially for tasks that require leaving the department. It can lead to unnecessary misunderstandings;\n[FireR]\n4. The internship period is critical for learning. Don’t constantly complain about having too much work. Either shift careers or study seriously. After starting a formal job, no one will teach you the procedures from scratch. Practice more yourself. Watching ten times doesn’t make you as proficient as doing it yourself once;\n[FireR]\n5. Occupational exposure can happen at any time, so ensure proper protection and never be careless. A colleague of mine once mishandled an operation, and blood from an AIDS patient sprayed on their face and even into their eyes. They took emergency preventive medication immediately. Be extremely cautious—you never know what’s in a patient's blood, and it’s not something worth gambling on. Don’t rely on post-exposure reporting forms. The procedure is very cumbersome to complete;\n[FireR]\n6. Don't fully open up to fellow interns. Stay alert. Smile more when dealing with mentors and patients. At the beginning, even if you miss the vein while injecting, you won’t get scolded. Mentors might often guide you through various operations. Many mentors are indeed very kind and supportive;\n[FireR]\n7. It’s challenging to find a job nowadays. Don’t waver just because some mentors complain about low pay and high workload and express their intention to resign. Remember, this was the profession you chose initially. Love your profession. Every field is difficult in its way, and everyone’s family background and choices differ;\n[FireR]\n8. No matter how busy your internship is, make time to study for your nursing qualification. The exam itself isn’t hard. If you procrastinate until just before the exam, time will be too tight. Read one page of concise notes by Lin Chaoyue every morning before work, memorize a few mnemonics. It doesn’t take much time, and having a general impression will help with answering the questions.",

It's probably because I've searched for articles about changing life states due to anxiety recently, and thus got labeled by the system?\n\t\nIt seems like in this era of labels, everyone on the platform labels themselves to attract like-minded netizens; the platform labels us to push content we care about more accurately. But it also seems like while showcasing individuality, we are losing it. Gaining traffic through individuality, but also following the same rules, isn't this also a form of domestication? Are we educating the search engine, or are we being engulfed by labels?\n\t\nBut the answer to these questions is often: overthinking is useless.\n\t\n-\nWhen WeChat Moments first became popular, I also often shared various aspects of my life there, sometimes including some personal preferences, opinions on certain matters. One particularly vivid memory: one day I shared my naive view on a hot event and posted a book cover image. Someone immediately commented below: Babe, straight men don't like these.\n\t\nMany people's first reaction might be: I don't care what he likes. But the reality was, I had been single for many years at that time, and actually had the thought of wanting to be in a relationship. So I suppressed my first reaction and then thought, would posting a selfie be better? Laughed.\n\t\nIn the past, when I came across many emotional bloggers, I would dismiss them, thinking, what are men, I need to learn to handle them. But when I encountered emotional issues myself, I would often search extensively online: what is he thinking by doing this, how should I respond. Using the universal gender rules I usually despise to deal with various issues in relationships.\n\t\nClear-headed in conversations with friends; continuing to sink in relationships.\n\t\nThe same goes for work and life.\n\t\n-\n\t\nIt's been a long time since I wrote a long piece of text. A test taker who almost got a full score in the college entrance exam composition now feels drained writing two hundred words. I'm labeling myself again, evidently domesticated by the times. Anyway, no one reads this kind of stuff, below are the tags for my article, I decide to put ten. [SmileR][SmileR][SmileR]",

The leg openings and waistband have ample elasticity, making it super comfortable even for sisters with wider hips and thicker legs.

Last time, I ordered the Sakura Shrimp Baked Lily, and this time I tried the Pumpkin Baked Lily. The preparation is similar, with the lilies being whole and incredibly fragrant, sweet, and soft. Today's best, no doubt, hahaha [Laugh R]\n\t\n• Then there's the Sweet Lotus Root, which I feel isn’t as good as southern desserts. The sauce was a bit too sweet, but the flavor was still acceptable～\n\t\n• For buns, we ordered the Osmanthus Lily Red Bean Bun～ There was a whole slice of lily inside. The red bean had a grainy texture, and the bun skin wasn’t too thick, but after eating a lot of southern buns, it didn’t stand out much. However, it was quite unique and worth a try～[Sneaky Smile R]\n\t\n• The Boiling Handheld Lamb was just okay. The price of 108 felt a bit low on cost-performance for such a large hotel, but the taste was acceptable～\n\t\n• My least favorite was the vegetarian dish. I originally thought it would be stir-fried, but it turned out to be braised with oil [Cover Face R]. Help! Vegetables should be light-flavored, but why was it cooked like this? The yam and water bamboo inside were hard to distinguish, okra was okay, but the biggest disappointment was the shrimp inside, which felt very unfresh. It was salted, leaving it overly salty and hard—a bit off-putting [Cover Face R][Cover Face R][Cover Face R]\n\t\n• The fruit plate they provided had pomelos and melons. The pomelo was so bitter it was almost inedible; they might as well not have given it [Cover Face R]\n\t\n• Overall, their lily products are worth trying and have distinctive features. The rest depends on personal taste [Cover Face R]. For three people, it cost 304. Everyone can reference this～",

At almost every shareholders' meeting, the founding team cues each shareholder to speak one by one. As the discussion goes on, a shareholder poses a soul-searching question:\n“Will there be a shareholders' meeting next year?” [Crying Laughing R]\n\t\nSilence falls, and everyone is stunned at first, followed by a wave of laughter to ease the atmosphere.\n\t\nA topic that everyone knows but avoids mentioning. [Crescent Moon R]\n\t\nSince the start of work this year, we have discussed many companies, and the theme is quite consistent: the main business still requires a lot of R&D in the short term, the market financing environment is not optimistic, and if we don't seek to generate blood on our own, the capital chain will likely break by the end of the year.\n\t\nAs investors, on the one hand, we are pleased that the founding team proactively adjusts strategies, lowers their stance, no longer focuses solely on high-end businesses, starts to expand their business scope, and focuses on how to achieve self-sufficiency; on the other hand, everyone knows that the commercialization of side businesses/products is not as simple as investing and getting returns, there are still many uncertainties, and distant water cannot save a near fire. So, ultimately, the topic of the shareholders' meeting still comes back to how to raise funds as soon as possible.\n\t\nAnd everyone knows how pessimistic the current market financing is, with state-owned capital defaulting from top to bottom, market-oriented professional investors tightening their funds, and capital-holding industry players gaining greater say, picking projects, cutting valuations, and so on. So where else can money come from?\n\t\nSome people think the answer might be non-professional investors, small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, who are still sensitive to business opportunities. The existence of specialized and scaled institutions in the past market has made the investment threshold very high, they couldn't compete and lost some good investment opportunities. Now that these institutions are contracting, the entry threshold for non-specialized, non-scaled small and medium-sized entrepreneurs has lowered, maybe they can become a new force in the market and continue to contribute to China's private economy?\n\t\nIn fact, I personally endorse this new financing expansion approach, the only reminder for the founding teams is to manage the expectations of these new investors, because they have been more businesspeople in the past, and businesspeople have their own logic for business, the simpler the better, making money, driven by interests, while many of our start-ups today focus on technology, and folk entrepreneurs have an incomplete understanding of technology commercialization, can they play the role of “long money”? If not, the subsequent communication costs might be extremely high. Disputes among shareholders can be enough to bring down a company, or at least cause the company to miss the best window period for business development.",

Pregnancy is a period that needs to be well protected, and the nutrients that need to be supplemented are really numerous!\n🤰When I was newly pregnant, I didn't think about prenatal calcium supplementation either. Fortunately, my sister-in-law reminded me in time, which saved me from the torment of leg cramps during pregnancy. Now I'm full of energy every day, and my complexion is even better than when I wasn't pregnant!\n💪The importance of calcium goes without saying. In the early stages of pregnancy, you can supplement it by drinking more milk, but by the second trimester, the baby's nutritional needs increase, and you need to arrange for calcium tablets promptly. When buying, try to choose liquid calcium with mild and easily absorbable ingredients, so as not to put pressure on the stomach.\n❗So, how to choose the right prenatal calcium tablets?\n🌟1. Check if there is authoritative certification. With authoritative certification, it is more reassuring and guaranteed to take.\n🌟2. Do not contain additives and flavorings, as they can cause irreversible harm to the pregnant mother's body.\n🌟3. Pay attention to the ingredient list. While rich nutrition is good, it's important to distinguish whether it's the nutrition your body needs. Irrelevant nutrition, no matter how much, is useless.\n🌟4. Pay attention to the absorption rate. The absorption rate means how much nutrition your body can convert, and of course, the more, the better.\n🌟5. Choose one that suits your needs and physique.\nAfter doing my homework and trying several effective prenatal calcium tablets, sisters in need, come and refer to the following👇\n✅Rui Cai Liquid Calcium\n✅Punu Calcium Tablets\n✅Diaoqiao Calcium Tablets\n✅Swisse Calcium Tablets\n✅Ostelin Calcium Tablets\n👩‍🦰Dear pregnant moms, prenatal calcium supplementation must not be taken lightly.

I'm not saying everyone should publish in low-quality journals, but we shouldn't limit ourselves strictly to SCI journals. It's rare for undergraduates to write exceptionally good papers, so being able to publish in a regular journal indexed by CNKI or an international conference also demonstrates your academic abilities, and this won't tarnish your academic record.\nWhat everyone needs to do is to avoid hiring ghostwriters or engaging in unethical academic practices!

        "content": "Note Title: The Truth No One Tells You About Being an Honest Person in the Workplace\n    Note Content: I'm Shan Shan. As a veteran of the workplace for ten years, I want to share a few truths that no one will proactively tell you when you first enter the workplace, but knowing them can save you years of detours.\n1. Merely being dedicated is not enough, results matter more    In the first few years after I graduated, I worked at a firm where the atmosphere was very simple. My job was to complete the tasks assigned by the seniors with quality and quantity. Those years, my work skills did grow, but my work EQ was a blank slate, not much different from a student. Later, I switched to a state-owned enterprise. During the interview, I stated that my dedication was 100 points, but the leader didn't fully agree. He said that in the company, the focus is on results. After I started working there, I slowly understood the meaning of this statement. For example, if you are in the company's quality control department, it's good to check the most detailed and strict, but this might block most of the business, making the company's survival a problem. Is your dedication still valuable at this point? Therefore, how to do the job well while keeping all parties relatively satisfied is much more important and difficult than just being dedicated.\n\n2. Getting along well with leaders and colleagues is more important than burying yourself in work   Don't think that interacting more with leaders and colleagues is tiring. People are emotional beings, and smooth interactions can make work progress more smoothly. I have a negative case around me. In a friend's department, there is a girl who is quite socially anxious. She usually gets along нормально with colleagues, but she is particularly afraid of communicating with the leader, avoiding it whenever possible. Her leader, on the other hand, likes to mingle with employees, but she avoids interacting with the leader. After a few back and forth, the leader wondered, do you have an issue with me? Gradually, his attitude towards her worsened, and she became even more afraid to communicate with the leader, forming a vicious cycle. Later, when the department needed to streamline staff, unfortunately, this colleague who was not familiar with the leader was the first to be streamlined. As for how to get along with the leader, if you are interested, I will talk more about it later.\n\n3. Working hard is not as good as mastering irreplaceable skills This point became deeply understood after many years of work when I encountered a real-life example. I knew a girl in a business department who was steadfast, reliable, and hardworking. Therefore, the leader assigned all the basic work to her. She was so busy that she had no weekends and no time to learn more professional knowledge. Of course, as encouragement, she, the hardworking ox, was often rated as an excellent employee. However, a year later, during an industry downturn and department downsizing, she was surprisingly laid off. Later, I met their leader and talked about this girl. He said that although she worked hard and diligently, for the department to operate normally, the professional structure must be sound. The implication was that others might not work as hard as her, but they had irreplaceable professional skills, the lack of which would affect the department's operation. This incident tells us that we need to be smarter in our work, always prioritizing the improvement of our professional capabilities.",

Additionally, Malaysia imposes a 10% consumption tax, which can be avoided by opening an overseas warehouse for local delivery.\n[Explosion R][Explosion R] Southeast Asia cross-border stores are a hellish start due to low barriers and many merchants. Many who have entered the game often share their store data on Xiaohongshu. You will see that many people either have a very low order rate or very little profit.\n[Celebrate R][Celebrate R] I am very clear about this!

The roof starts 30 meters high from the ridge, with tiles directly touching the alley, creating rare open spaces. The slanted geometric shapes add new visual trajectories to the vertical linear streets, visually integrating the town and hills. The forest backdrop overlaps with the roof, forming a layered facade and creating a new visual experience. The entrance penetrates the roof, leading visitors into another world, breaking the boundaries between architecture and environment, flatness and facades. Interactive programs such as cafes, galleries, and yoga areas redefine the space, showcasing efficient site utilization. Aerial corridors connect guest rooms, each offering unique views and introducing 2.5D space design, emphasizing specific visual movements and functions. Movable sculptural walls create multidimensional spatial experiences, highlighting the play of light and shadow.

Pregnancy is a period that needs to be well protected, and the nutrients needed are really super numerous!\n🤰When I was newly pregnant, I didn't think about prenatal calcium supplementation either. Fortunately, my sister-in-law reminded me in time, which saved me from the torment of leg cramps during pregnancy. Now I am full of energy every day, and my complexion is even better than when I was not pregnant!\n💪The importance of calcium goes without saying. In the early stages of pregnancy, you can supplement by drinking more milk, but by the second trimester, the baby's nutritional needs increase, and you need to arrange for calcium tablets promptly. When buying, try to choose a mild and easily absorbable liquid calcium to avoid putting pressure on the stomach.\n❗So, how to choose the right prenatal calcium tablets?\n🌟1. Check if there is authoritative certification, which makes it safer and more guaranteed to take.\n🌟2. Do not contain additives and flavors, as they can cause irreversible harm to the pregnant mom's body.\n🌟3. Pay attention to the ingredient list. While rich nutrition is good, it's important to distinguish whether it's the nutrition your body needs. Irrelevant nutrients are useless no matter how many there are.\n🌟4. Pay attention to the absorption rate, which means how much nutrition your body can convert, and of course, the more, the better.\n🌟5. Choose one that suits your own needs and constitution.\nAfter doing my homework, I tried several effective prenatal calcium tablets. Sisters in need, come and refer to the following👇\n✅Rui Calcium Liquid Calcium\n✅Punuo Calcium Tablets\n✅Diaoqiao Calcium Tablets\n✅Swisse Calcium Tablets\n✅Ostelin Calcium Tablets\n👩‍🦰Dear pregnant moms, prenatal calcium supplementation must not be taken lightly. Be sure to carefully choose the right calcium tablets for yourself, so that your baby can grow up healthily, and you can also comfortably get through pregnancy!",

The effort put into maintaining cleanliness surpasses that of a typical household.\n\n- Role 2: Store Manager/Cashier. Juggling these roles simultaneously, especially when understaffed, means handling sales, customer service, and cashier duties all alone.\n\n- Role 3: Loader/Dispatcher. Often, I see notices like 'Goods delivered to central store, please collect'. It's common for staff to handle their own logistics, from transporting goods to unloading them. \n\n[EmbarassedR] Role 4: IT Specialist. In this digital age, basic computer skills are essential. From creating spreadsheets to data analysis, and even troubleshooting tech issues, the scope is vast.

From my personal study results, coenzyme Q10 is very useful and necessary for sisters with premature ovarian failure, long-term infertility, and low AMH values!\nAbout how to choose the right coenzyme Q10 for yourself, let's take a look today↓\nFirst, let's see what coenzyme Q10 is?\n🥬Coenzyme Q10 is one of the essential elements in the human body, it exists in human cells and is used by cells to produce and manage energy.\n.\n🔍After understanding the importance of coenzyme Q10, let's see how to choose coenzyme Q10?\n✅Check the dosage\nPregnant women need to supplement 200mg of coenzyme per day, 100mg per dose, twice a day. Choose according to your own needs, not the more the better. Those with other needs are advised to consult a doctor before choosing the right dosage for themselves.\n✅Check the coenzyme ingredients\nThe more important thing for pregnancy is to improve the mitochondrial function of cells. When cell energy is sufficient, the development of eggs and the vitality of sperm can be improved. Therefore, when choosing coenzyme, it is necessary to see whether the overall formula is targeted for pregnancy.\n✅Check the coenzyme form\nReduced coenzyme can be directly absorbed by the human body after entering, because most of the coenzymes in the human body are in the reduced form. Oxidized coenzyme needs to be converted into reduced form before it can be absorbed by the human body.\nIf there are still sisters who don't know how to choose, you can take a look at the few good ones I put behind, you can refer to them",

        "content": "Note Title: I finally understand, this is how to learn during the first round of review!\n    Note Content: 1. Grade 10 and Grade 11 should pave the way for Grade 12, not use Grade 12 to make up for shortcomings from Grade 10 and Grade 11.\nThe saying \"A shaky foundation leads to a crumbling building\" is never outdated. I have encountered many Grade 12 students who paid a painful price in their college entrance exams because they didn't take this saying seriously.\nGrade 10 and Grade 11 are preparation periods for Grade 12. Doing your best in these two years is paving the way for Grade 12. It is not about putting off understanding certain concepts or memorizing facts until the first round of review.\nThe first round of review is the last chance given by college entrance exams to turn things around. This golden opportunity is for breakthroughs and catching up, not for cleaning up messes left behind from the past.\n① Chinese and English: Memorize what needs to be memorized. If you don’t remember vocabulary, you cannot score in the exam—it’s the same as not memorizing classical Chinese texts and losing marks in dictation sections.\nTake advantage of the time when academic pressure is not yet overwhelming to tackle the easier parts. So by Grade 12, you can focus on the harder tasks. Don’t end up memorizing classical Chinese texts or vocabulary, accumulated over several semesters, while others are working on complex questions in Grade 12.\n② Math and Physics:\nPut in more time and effort. It’s better to do more than to do less.\nIf you don’t practice enough math problems, your grades won’t improve. If you don’t master functions, it will be hard to understand other parts. So, give importance to the basics from Grade 10. If you don’t understand, keep revisiting until the core issues are clear.\nIf you can’t keep up with the required thinking in physics, your scores won’t improve. The core of physics is in Grade 10; if you don’t understand it, Grade 11 will be nearly impossible.\nThis is a subject that heavily depends on the teacher’s skill level. Why are the overall scores higher in prestigious schools? Not just because they move faster in terms of progress. More importantly, their teachers are highly skilled and cover the material in a comprehensive manner. They teach basic knowledge, core theories, problem types, and secondary conclusions extensively.\n2. Solve these issues before the first round of review\nThe first round of review is not for cleaning up messes. Therefore, you need to address lingering issues before the first round starts.\nEliminate weaknesses in subjects: Before the formal start of the first round, address imbalances in your subjects. When all six subjects enter the first-round review simultaneously, the pace will be fast and the pressure high. Important subjects will take up a lot of time, leaving no room to deal with weaker ones.\nBasic knowledge: Some fundamental principles won’t be taught in the first round of review.\nSo think back to Grade 10—were there any very basic concepts you didn’t grasp? For example, in the area of force composition and decomposition, teachers won’t break it down into every major and minor category during the first round of review but will instead just skim over it.",

Moreover, working in a restaurant allows exposure to diverse groups of people, which helps improve language communication skills and understanding of local culture.\nHowever, there are also some challenges. Work hours can be long, especially during busy periods, often requiring prolonged standing, which can lead to physical fatigue. Wage levels may not be high, particularly in some small restaurants. Additionally, the work environment can be noisy and hectic, requiring good stress management and adaptability.\nRegarding wages, income varies depending on the type, size, and location of the restaurant, as well as individual work experience and position. Generally, waitstaff may earn extra income through tips, but the base wage may not be high; kitchen helpers have relatively stable wages, but overall income may be limited.\nIf Chinese individuals want to achieve better income and development in restaurant work, they may need to accumulate experience and enhance skills, such as learning cooking techniques, mastering management knowledge, etc., to strive for higher positions or work in more upscale restaurants.",

Want to change this state of life but don’t know how? It's actually very simple: keep learning throughout your life. Now, learning a new technology and rapidly developing in a new field is not a problem at all! I sincerely recommend everyone take a look at in-car testing, as there are many successful examples around me. A junior colleague in my group switched to in-car testing and, after just 12 months, her monthly salary reached 12,000 RMB! 💼\n-\n🌟So, what exactly is in-car testing? Today, I will give you an introduction:\n-\n🚗What is in-car testing?\n-\nIn-car testing involves testing various smart car modules, including software and hardware testing, performance testing, functional testing, and so on. Although it involves both software and hardware testing, the requirements for hardware are not very high.\n-\n🚦Knowledge and skills needed for in-car testing:\n-\n📚Testing knowledge: automotive network communication protocols, test environment setup, understanding of industry structures, etc.\n-\n🛠Testing skills: mastery of testing processes, smart cockpit, dashboard, ADAS testing, etc.\n-\n🛣Development prospects of in-car testing\n-\nWith the continuous development of new energy vehicles, the application of automotive smart modules and software is gradually increasing, and the demand for software testing is also rising. In the future, the demand for in-car testing engineers will increase significantly.\n-\n👩‍🎓Can it be learned from scratch?\n-\nOf course! In-car testing falls under the testing category, making it easy to learn and with a low entry barrier. For beginners, it's a very friendly direction to start learning. After studying, you need to practice more to enrich project experience.\n-\n💐For friends who feel lost about their future career paths, consider learning in-car testing. Beginners can quickly get started, and junior college graduates can also handle it well. In-car testing is still in its infancy stage, and the industry is almost vacant in China. With the continuous development of new energy vehicles, the future development trend will get better and better, offering many great opportunities! Keep it up, everyone! 💪🌟",

Everyone must practice a lot of questions and avoid being lazy [Prohibited R]. Reading is also a matter where quantitative change leads to qualitative change.\nI have also compiled some experiences and methods to share with everyone\n❌Do not start doing questions right away, unless your foundation is very good. I suffered a lot because my foundation was not good at the beginning, and I started doing questions right away [Crying R][Crying R]. Especially some misleading options, it's easy to get frustrated after a few questions. Later, I changed my strategy, directly looking at the answers and taking notes, which reduces the possibility of being disturbed.\n\t\n🌟Preparation Order FIBRW＞FIBR＞RO, just practice the high-frequency question bank. After finishing, you can use the remaining question bank to practice your language sense. Sometimes in reading, it's not about understanding the question, but mainly about fixed collocations and grammar.\n✅Practice Methods\n1⃣️Print FIBRW questions with answers and do intensive reading (mainly focusing on the context before and after the blanks. During regular practice, read the entire passage to understand the meaning, so that if you encounter the same question in the exam, you will remember it more deeply)\n2⃣️Directly look at the answers and take notes❗Only record fixed collocations or phrases\n3⃣️Practice in groups, such as 10 per group, and practice again after intensive reading a group (accumulate the quantity, and your language sense will improve. Those with a good foundation can practice half of the high-frequency question bank, while those with a weak foundation or ample time are recommended to go through the entire high-frequency question bank more than once)\n4⃣️Simulated practice, which must be based on 3⃣️ and after accumulating language sense through a large number of questions, to do new questions that have not been practiced. This way, you can test your language sense, and you can use questions from the total question bank.\n‼️Make sure to practice RA well, as RA contributes 30% to the reading score\n\t\nIf you want the materials I gathered during my preparation, leave a comment 111\nAnd some recent materials I found for everyone [Smiling R][Smiling R]\n\t\nI hope everyone can successfully pass the reading section\nIf you want to know about other question types, let me know, and I will prepare them in advance.

Back then, I was rejected by Heidelberg, and it broke my heart for a while. I didn’t apply to Munich—hmm, maybe for someone in liberal arts like me, the education program in Munich didn’t seem that appealing.\nSpeaking of which, UCL in my impression was not very remarkable; how come it’s ranked so high! Oh, maybe it’s just my education major that’s weak; I heard their biology and other fields are quite strong.\nContinuing on, okay, KUL stays still; FU, wow, squeezed into the top 100! So where has HU been spending its money recently?\n\t\nWhy are the top ones still U.S. and U.K., holding on tightly (dominance)?\n\t\nOne last thing to mention, I’m not criticizing TUM or LMU. Some of their programs are really strong, and this post shouldn’t discourage anyone from applying to Munich. It’s just that because of my field, I’ve read a lot of related literature about elite universities, the origins of rankings, their indicators, etc., so this post is just a way of venting about those schools that throw money around and debunking the myth of rankings.",

In Germany: When someone says they are from Munich, first, the word Munich is associated with regional stereotypes: a weed-filled village; then you ask, oh, studying at TUM? Such a remote place with nothing there (a disdainful comment from someone in Berlin).\nJust kidding, just kidding. Honestly, rankings don't mean much in Germany, no one labels someone based on their ranking background.\nSpeaking of which, it's much easier for Germans to apply to TUM than for international students. I was heartbroken for a while after being rejected by Heidelberg; I didn't apply to Munich. Hmm, maybe for a humanities student like me, Munich's education program really isn't that appealing.\nBy the way, by the way, in my impression, UCL wasn't that outstanding; how is its ranking so high! Oh, maybe it's just my field of education that's mediocre. I heard their biology programs are quite strong.\nLet’s continue, okay, KUL stays put; FU, impressive, made it into the top 100. So recently, where has HU been spending its money?\n\t\nHow is it still the US and UK at the top, firmly holding the (leader) position?\n\t\nOne more note, I’m not dissing TUM or LMU, as some programs there are still very strong. Don’t avoid applying to Munich just because of my post. Due to my professional background, I’ve read a lot of relevant literature about elite universities, the origins of rankings’ indicators, etc. So writing this post is just me venting about those money-burning schools + demystifying rankings.",

Xiao Jin is a sweaty head baby who never sleeps soundly and sweats a lot! Recently, I found a treasure, a highly praised baby pillow - Shell Diary Children's Silicone Pillow.\n-\n🔺**Adjustable Height**\nThis baby pillow can meet the needs of children of different ages. Its unique adjustable height design allows for corresponding adjustments as the child grows, ensuring proper support for the cervical spine. From infancy to elementary school, one pillow fits all, accompanying every stage of the child's growth.\n-\n2🔺 **Easy to Clean**\nFor busy parents, cleaning baby's items is often a challenge. This silicone pillow takes this into consideration and is specially designed to be machine washable. Easy to wash, ensuring the pillow always remains clean and hygienic, giving the baby a healthy sleeping environment.\n-\n🔺 **Excellent Breathability**\nMade of high-quality silicone material, this pillow has excellent breathability. It is breathable and not stuffy, with plenty of ventilation holes to keep it dry and comfortable even on hot summer days, allowing the baby to sleep soundly all night.\n-\n🔺 **Soft and Comfortable**\nThis pillow is full of details, using soft materials to ensure a gentle and delicate touch on the baby's skin, as if floating on clouds, providing care for the baby.\n-\n🔺**Carefully Selected Materials**\nIn the selection of materials, food-grade silicone material is used, so it's safe even if the baby bites it! Since Xiao Jin in our family switched to this pillow, his sleep quality has significantly improved. He can fall asleep peacefully every night and wake up refreshed in the morning. He's happy every day! It's really good, and I want to recommend it to all moms in the world!",

Now that I think about it, we've relaxed quite a bit.\nPreviously, when his grandparents helped him with his homework, he would procrastinate heavily. Usually, he would start doing homework right after school and keep going until 11 PM. He had countless little distractions in between, or he would daydream, basically anything but actually doing homework. After transferring schools, sometimes I would stand very close, giving him a sense of pressure to get him to write. Honestly, the assigned homework wasn't even that much, and I didn't give him any extra tasks. When I asked other parents, they told me their kids could finish all their homework in just two hours. I felt utterly helpless and tried everything I could think of.\nLater, due to various reasons, we had the child diagnosed with ADHD and began intervention therapy. Only now do I realize how much my child has truly changed. It's been so long since I last worried about his studies. He no longer procrastinates on his homework until so late in the evening.

A good chartered driver took us to all the must-visit spots~\nHulunbuir is great! But it's really tiring too 🥲\nSharing some genuine feelings and insights about Hulunbuir!\nWe mainly explored the 5-day northern loop of Hulunbuir. Our group consisted of four adults and two children. For safety, we chose a private chartered tour. We contacted the driver through Xiaohongshu, and the whole trip was with 6 people plus the driver for 5 days. We informed the driver about the specific number of days we wanted to play before departure, and the driver helped us plan and recommend routes and activities based on the time and places we wanted to visit. He carefully instructed us on what to bring. We gathered in Hailar and then started our 5-day trip to Hulunbuir.\n-\n😥 About the weather in Hulunbuir\nHulunbuir is indeed a summer resort, the weather is really cool, but!! The UV rays are really strong, and after a round of activities, we all got significantly darker.\n😥 About transportation in Hulunbuir\nTo be honest, Hulunbuir is really vast, and the distances between various attractions are quite far. I'm not someone who can sit in a car for a long time, and I felt so nauseous that I wanted to throw up all the time. Luckily, the driver brought motion sickness medicine, so if you get carsick, make sure to prepare well and bring motion sickness medicine!!\nMore details are compiled in the pictures, remember to save them.\n.\n😥 About the attractions\nThere are too many, so I'll just list some recommendations on whether to visit or not.\n✅ Recommended:\n✅ Heishantou: You can stay in Mongolian yurts here, enjoy bonfire parties, and there are many activities. You must experience horseback riding to watch the sunset!\n✅ Morin Gol River: Known as the most winding river in the world, it meanders gracefully and is considered the most beautiful spot on the grassland.\n✅ Erguna Wetland: Note ⚠️ There are two Erguna Wetlands, visit the National Wetland Park! It's very beautiful.\n✅ Balhu Mongolian Tribe: The horse dance performance here is worth watching, quite spectacular.\n✅ Enhe: A tranquil village, very peaceful with a pastoral idyll feel 🎑\n✅ Border Road: Also known as the Card Line, this road passes through beautiful wetlands, grasslands, and rivers.\n❌ Not Recommended:\nMammoth Park: It's an artificial attraction with not much to see.\nNational Gate Scenic Area: You can see the National Gate from the outside, but entering requires a fee. Photos can be taken from outside.\nBirch Forest: If you're not going for the reindeer, you can see plenty of birch forests on the way to Heishantou without any fee.",

        "content": "Note Title: The Truth No One Tells You About Being an Honest Person in the Workplace\n    Note Content: I'm Shan Shan. As a veteran of the workplace for ten years, I want to share a few truths that no one will proactively tell you when you first enter the workplace, but knowing them can save you years of detours.\n1. Merely being dedicated is not enough, effectiveness is more important    When I first graduated and worked in a firm, the atmosphere was very simple. My job was to complete the tasks assigned by the seniors with quality and quantity. Those years, my work skills did grow, but my work EQ was a blank slate, not much different from a student. Later, I switched to a state-owned enterprise. During the interview, I stated that my dedication was 100 points, but the leader wasn't very convinced. He said that in the company, the focus is on results. After I started working there, I slowly understood the meaning of this. For example, if you are in the company's quality control department, it's good to check the most detailed and strict, but this might block most of the business, making the company's survival a problem. Is your dedication still valuable at this point? Therefore, how to do the job well while keeping everyone relatively satisfied is much more important and difficult than just being dedicated.\n\n2. Getting along well with leaders and colleagues is more important than just working hard   Don't think that interacting more with leaders and colleagues is tiring. People are emotional beings, and smooth interactions can make work progress more smoothly. I have a negative example. In a friend's department, there was a girl who was quite socially anxious. She got along normally with colleagues but was particularly afraid of interacting with the leader, avoiding it whenever possible. Her leader, however, liked to mingle with employees, but she avoided interacting with the leader. After a few interactions, the leader wondered, do you have an issue with me? Gradually, his attitude towards her worsened, and she became even more afraid to communicate with the leader, forming a vicious cycle. Later, when the department needed to downsize, unfortunately, this colleague who was not familiar with the leader was the first to be let go. As for how to get along with leaders, if you are interested, I will talk more about it later.\n\n3. Working hard is not as good as mastering irreplaceable skills This point became deeply understood after years of work and encountering real-life examples. I knew a girl in a business department who was reliable and hardworking, so the leader assigned all the basic tasks to her. She was so busy that she had no weekends and no time to learn more professional knowledge. Of course, as encouragement, she was often rated as an outstanding employee. However, a year later, during an industry downturn and department downsizing, she was surprisingly laid off. Later, I met their leader and talked about this girl. He said that although she was serious and hardworking, for the department to operate normally, the professional structure must be sound. The implication was that others might not work as hard as her, but they had irreplaceable professional skills, the lack of which would affect the department's operation. This incident tells us that work should be done smartly, always prioritizing the improvement of your professional capabilities.",
