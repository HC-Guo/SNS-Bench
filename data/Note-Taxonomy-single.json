I Gave Up UCL to Come to HKU\n    Note Content: In this post, I'll tell you why I chose to come to HKU\n\t\nI was from a non-top university for both undergraduate and graduate studies, determined to change my life through postgraduate entrance exams! While my classmates were just enjoying their college life, I started preparing for the exams in a gradual manner. Everything was going smoothly until the final sprint in my senior year, when I secretly started dating a few months before the exams without telling my parents, which turned out to be the most regrettable decision I ever made...\n\t\nAs expected, I failed the entrance exams.\n\t\nMy ex-boyfriend never intended to compete in mainland China; he decided to come to Hong Kong for his postgraduate studies from the beginning. After I failed the exams, he comforted me and suggested that I come to Hong Kong with him.\n\t\nCompared to Hong Kong, as an English major undergraduate, I actually preferred to go to the UK, especially since my best friend also got into UCL, which seemed to have a halo in my eyes.\n\t\nAfter a long period of consideration, I finally found the teacher who helped my friend get into UCL. She told me that applying to Hong Kong could also help with a free application to the UK and suggested that I apply to both. I thought it was perfect for me! Since I decided to study abroad after the entrance exams, time was extremely tight. Additionally, my friend assured me that the teacher was reliable, so I paid üí∞ that day and asked her to start my application.\n\t\nWith her help, the application process went smoothly, and soon I received offers from both HKU and UCL ü•π.\n\t\nHowever, due to my ex-boyfriend, I ultimately gave up UCL and came to HKU.\n\t\nAs a new couple in a new environment, we took care of each other, and everything was great at first. Although I couldn't go to my dream school UCL, I was still happy. After two months, I noticed that my boyfriend was always on his phone, and he had even changed his phone password. My intuition told me something was wrong. One time, when he wasn't paying attention, I checked his phone and discovered that shortly after we arrived in Hong Kong, he started flirting with another girl, lying to her that he didn't have a girlfriend.\n\t\nI was heartbroken. I had given up my dream school for him, thinking that at least I still had him, but his words 'I don't have a girlfriend, I'm single!' felt like a hammer shattering my heart into pieces!\nNow we have broken up, and I'm living in the room we used to share...\n\t\n#Hong Kong Life[Topic]# #Study Abroad[Topic]# #International Students[Topic]# #International Students[Topic]# #Ex-Boyfriend[Topic]# #UCL[Topic]# #Relationship[Topic]# #HKU[Topic]# #Top Three Universities in Hong Kong[Topic]# #Application to Top Eight Universities in Hong Kong[Topic]# #Hong Kong Study[Topic]# #Study in Hong Kong[Topic]#",

Before 11 am, there were already many people waiting to get a number, so it's best to come early.\n\t\nFor the appetizer, we ordered #Fagara [Topic]# skewersüç¢ (P1), which were very refreshing, slightly numbing and aromatic. The all-vegetarian combination was also healthy and satisfying for #Vegetarian [Topic]# tastes. Unfortunately, there's only one reply on @Dianping, making me sigh again that #Sichuan Cuisine [Topic]# still has a limited audience in Beijing, which also gives rise to #Reformed Sichuan Cuisine [Topic]# or #New Style Sichuan Cuisine [Topic]# (P.S., correcting a #Translation [Topic]# mistake I've wanted to share for a long time, Sichuan peppercorn should not be translated as numbing pepper because numbing refers to numbness, not the spicy sensation on the taste buds; a more accurate or fitting version should be tickling).\n\t\nFor the soup, we chose #Mom's Pig Trotter [Topic]#, similar to many Sichuan restaurants in Beijing, it seemed to have learned the form but lacked in flavor compared to the few restaurants near #Chengdu Half Bridge [Topic]#, being less thick and lacking the melt-in-your-mouth texture that Chengdu people call 'xiluopa' (this actually reflects the skill in stewing), which cannot be achieved by just using a pressure cooker; it must be simmered slowly over low heat.\n\t\nFor the main dishes, we ordered #Eel [Topic]# and #Bullfrog [Topic]#. Personally, I felt the eel's flavor was a bit too innovative, as I only realized later that it contained #Pickled Vegetable [Topic]#. This method is almost non-existent in the Chengdu eel dishes I've tried, and typically in Chengdu, eel is first marinated in wine (because eel has a strong muddy taste), then stir-fried dry with oil, and finally fried with Erjing chili peppers (see P5 for the Sichuan Office's eel preparation). The bullfrog (P4) tasted relatively okay, but it was added with pumpkin. Excuse me, which chef came up with this 'good' idea? I dare say you can't find this bullfrog and pumpkin combination in Chengdu! No wonder no one posted pictures of these two dishes on Dianping. @Ma Liu Ji, don't mind my being outspoken.",

It comes with natural silver sand ore, which has a slight sparkle effect under the sun or light. No patterns, cracks, or water lines.

'Ru porcelain cracking can nurture gold wire and iron lines.'\nThere are various descriptions of the cracking of Ru porcelain, such as crab claw patterns, ice crack patterns, cicada wing patterns, and fish roe patterns, but I think using cicada wing patterns to describe it is just right. The shades interweave and overlap, resembling the texture of cicada wings. When drinking tea, the tea juice seeps into the cracks, forming natural tea stains. Different teas produce different shades of patterns, becoming a wonderful decoration, hence the term 'nurturing cups,' which is deeply loved by tea art enthusiasts.\nAfter careful nurturing and handling by collectors, unexpected spirituality often emerges. The changes in the cicada wing patterns are diverse, becoming your personal tea cup patterns. The changes in Ru porcelain cracking can only be felt through use, where the joy lies. Collectors can immerse themselves in the traditional culture of Ru kiln and appreciate the cultural heritage of ceramic tea ware.\nThe texture of Ru kiln glaze is uncontrollable, please refer to the actual product received.\nHigh-temperature glaze with appliqu√©, non-fading, blue and white ancient dragon pattern decoration, ink painting scenery, the dragon's three claws are sharp, the dragon soars with wings, vibrant. The blue and white dragon pattern is vivid, reflecting a strong folk life atmosphere.\nAs a decoration, the dragon pattern symbolizes power, identity, and status. In the ancient society with clear social hierarchy, objects with dragon patterns were extremely precious. 'Having a thousand gold is not as good as having a treasure at home, having a treasure at home is not as good as having a porcelain treasure in the court.'\n#High-end Tea Ware[Topic]# #Craftsman's Shining Daily[Topic]# #Handmade Ceramics[Topic]# #Beauty of Tea Ware[Topic]# #Fairy Tea Ware[Topic]# #Summon Tea Friends[Topic]# #Recommended Good Tea Ware[Topic]# #Share My Daily Tea Ware[Topic]# #Travel Tea Ware[Topic]# #Portable Tea Ware[Topic]# #Tea Ware[Topic]# #Brew a Pot of Good Tea[Topic]# #Tea Life[Topic]# #Travel Tea Ware[Topic]# #Portable Travel Tea Ware[Topic]# #Car Travel Tea Ware[Topic]# #Bring Your Own Travel Tea Ware[Topic]# #Tea Ware Travel Set[Topic]# #Portable Travel Tea Ware for Outdoor Afternoon Tea[Topic]# #Portable Travel Tea Ware[Topic]# #Travel Tea Ware Set[Topic]# #Outdoor Tea Drinking Travel Tea Ware[Topic]# #Travel Tea Ware with Bag[Topic]# #Tea Drinking Travel Tea Ware[Topic]# #Ru Kiln[Topic]# #Ru Kiln Quick Cup[Topic]# #Ru Kiln Travel Tea Ware[Topic]# #Quick Cup[Topic]# #Travel Quick Cup[Topic]# #Quick Cup Gift Set[Topic]# #Ceramic Quick Cup[Topic]# #Ru Kiln Tea Ware[Topic]# #Ru Kiln Quick Cup[Topic]# #Yuan Blue and White[Topic]# #Imitation Yuan Blue and White[Topic]# #Yuan Blue and White Dragon Pattern[Topic]# #Blue and White Dragon Pattern[Topic]# #Blue and White Porcelain[Topic]# #Summer Ceramic Plan[Topic]# #Tea Ware[Topic]# #Product Note Seedling Support Plan[Topic]#",

Currently, physical stores in other categories are starting to submit materials for review and queuing. So, why are businesses rushing to join Xiaohongshu group buying?\n1. Now is the best time for businesses to join. With fewer merchants and more users at present, entering now ensures the best traffic opportunity.\n2. The platform will provide traffic support to merchants who join, which means if you carefully create notes and upload more visually appealing works, the platform will promote them. The exposure for each work will be at least 10,000.\n3. The platform's users are mostly women aged 19-35, representing the main force in the local lifestyle market.\n4. Other platforms are also operational, and most works can be copied over, saving a team operational cost or, for individuals, saving significant time.\nGiven these four points, whoever joins first will gain the early advantage.

The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge has a sense of grandeur, while Parrot Island has a touch of softness, perhaps because of its red hue. Especially at night, when all the lights are on, it is extremely beautiful. Under the bridge, by the riverbanks, there are reeds swaying in the wind, and many benches are set up for people to enjoy the river scenery. The breeze by the river is also very pleasant. People sing, dance, indulge in photography, fly drones, or simply take a leisurely walk, all in a relaxed state. I now understand why Wuhan people are generally not overweight (I have been eating noodles here every day). A stroll along the river is already sufficient exercise. The city thrives along the river, and people live by the river. They all coexist in the sound of the ship whistles. #ParrotIslandYangtzeRiverBridge[Topic]#",

(However, it‚Äôs not recommended for elderly people as the slope is quite steep. Coming down can be hard on the knees, requiring trekking poles or sturdy tree branches for support. The trail is filled with gravel, making it quite slippery!) It‚Äôs not too difficult for those who exercise occasionally!\n\t\nAdditionally, the trailhead of the Lindeman Trail actually offers several trails to choose from. After reaching Lindeman Lake, those with ample stamina can continue to challenge the longer Green Drop Lake trail.

At that moment, I wondered why he couldn't come to pick me up. I, too, want a bit more care from them, feeling so wronged inside.\n   Talked about family in Xinjiang, and I mentioned to my dad that we should visit Xinjiang someday. He said we could go when the cotton-picking season is over, as plane tickets will be cheaper then; we could fly there to see the snowy mountains (though I have no idea where the snowy mountains are, but I‚Äôm very happy inside).

Therefore, the building is defined as a simple layered volume. This element creates a new public space on its roof and connects the existing routes at different levels on both sides of the river.\nThe building addresses its relationship with the surrounding environment through the definition of its main facade. The triangular openings are characteristic of the main internal spaces of the building and create a unique visual effect through the vegetation along the river, providing the dance school with a distinct identity.\nThe project is divided into two levels: the upper level for private use and the lower level for public use. This separation first allows for different entrances, thereby activating the circulation around the building; secondly, different scales are used in the two levels, and the floor directly in contact with the Limmat River enhances the public nature of the building.\n\t\n\nSource: Barozzi Veiga\n¬†\n#Switzerland[Topic] #Zurich[Topic] #Architecture[Topic] #DesignCaseSharing[Topic] #ArchitecturalPhotography[Topic] #DanceSchool[Topic] #DanceEveryday[Topic] #DanceStudio[Topic] #BarozziVeiga[Topic]",

The shopping experience was challenging, but no regrets! \t\nSince April last year, I've been wanting to gift myself a watch as a reward for years of hard work. Initially, I struggled between Chopard Happy Diamonds and Rolex Datejust entry models (my original budget was only 50,000-60,000 RMB). To make a careful choice, I specifically visited the Ba Bai Ban counter to try them on. Based on the texture and appearance, I decisively chose Rolex. Although many might think it looks flashy or ostentatious, I was instantly captivated üòÇüòÇüòÇ (Forgive me, I inherently love things that are golden and sparkly). Since the local stores had limited options, I couldn't confirm which model to choose. Just as I was debating in frustration, I came across Xiaohongshu and am very thankful for the many users who shared their watch shopping experiences, which helped me a lot. After comparing prices across different regions, I decided to ask a friend in France to purchase one. Initially, I looked at the 28mm non-diamond pink dial model, which was priced at 61,000 RMB after discounts in China and 57,000 RMB in France. Unfortunately, it was out of stock (with no confirmed delivery date). After waiting for a month and feeling anxious, I decided to increase my budget and settled on the 28mm diamond bezel, non-diamond green dial. The expected delivery was two months (September), but unfortunately, after waiting two and a half months, it still didn't arrive. Finally, I decided to give up, feeling utterly drained. Luckily, just as I decided not to proceed with the purchase, this Everose Gold and Steel model with a diamond-set olive-green dial became available. It's so stunning, and the price was super üòú attractive. While it far exceeded my budget, I instantly felt it was fate. So, tightening my belt, I decisively went for it. After more than five months, I finally got the watch of my dreams.\t\nHaving worn it for over half a year now, I still find it extremely satisfying. If you're considering getting one, don't hesitate! It's truly beautiful. üòéüòé\n\t\n\n¬†#rolex[topic]#¬†¬†#Rolex[topic]#",

He mastered the key points of the movements, but couldn't swim continuously; he would stop after swimming two meters\nEarly this year, I checked the swimming pool near our home, which had been upgraded and changed its mode, adopting a long-term approach to learning, starting with freestyle, which was also more expensive. After much consideration, I decided to get a monthly card to try it out, thinking that with the foundation from last year, it should go faster\nDuring the learning process, I was always unsure whether the child could swim on his own, but it seemed that his strength this year was better than last year, and he could swim farther at the beginning compared to last year\nOf course, with a long-term approach, you won't learn everything quickly in just one month\nBut during the last lesson yesterday, seeing the child able to swim 25 meters on his back, even though he hadn't mastered the arm movements yet, I comforted myself thinking that it should also count as self-protection in the water [Raised Eyebrow R][Raised Eyebrow R]\nWhat do you think?\n#Learning to Swim[Topic]# #Swimming Check-in[Topic]# #Backstroke[Topic]#",

During this period, I encountered many pitfalls and also summarized some of my own experiences. The biggest difference between a Law Master's degree based on a law background compared to a non-law background is the high proportion of subjective questions, which requires extensive memorization of materials. For example, short answer questions account for 40 points in the basic courses. If you haven't memorized the relevant knowledge points for the questions, you lose 10 points. Therefore, memorization becomes the most crucial and easiest step to improve scores in the Law Master's exam.\nLessons from the first attempt:\nDuring the first attempt, I believed in some experience post that claimed \"memorizing the exam analysis word for word could get you into Peking University.\" The theory itself is correct, but is it really feasible to memorize the entire exam analysis word for word? I believe most first-time candidates cannot achieve this level. With a score of 340, I analyzed some reasons for my failure: my English and political scores were average, but my professional course scores were too low, mainly due to significant mistakes in my short answer questions. During the first attempt, I estimated that I lost more than 30 points in short answer questions because I only had a vague impression of one out of the four criminal and civil law short answer questions, and even that was not very accurate. After reflection, I deeply understood that for the Law Master's exam, memorization should not be \"detailed\" but \"comprehensive.\" For essay questions, it is also important to use key sentences as an outline and expand to write content that fits the question. Therefore, in the second attempt, I realized that knowing which parts are the key memorization points and which are secondary, and memorizing the key points with a structured framework while understanding the secondary points, is the best method to break through the Law Master's exam in one or two years. This is also the most efficient and fastest way to improve scores.\nHere is my memorization method, shared for everyone to discuss together:\nBefore memorizing, I listen to the relevant recitation lessons or read through the knowledge points I am about to memorize to ensure I am clear about the key and secondary points for the day. During the memorization process, I first sort out the overall memorization framework and then start memorizing specific knowledge points. While memorizing, I constantly remind myself which points are key for detailed memorization and which are secondary for brief memorization, keeping my mind clear and not just reading without thinking. After memorizing, I review the framework and key content as a whole to ensure that the detailed points are firmly remembered and that I can express the secondary points in my own words. After a few days, I quickly review the framework and key points again to ensure continuous review and prevent forgetting.\nI will continue to update in the future, so those interested can follow for more [Thumbs Up R][Thumbs Up R]\n#Law Master's Exam Preparation[Topic]# #Law Master's Entrance Exam[Topic]# #Law[Topic]# #Law Master's[Topic]# #My Graduate Entrance Exam[Topic]# #Graduate Entrance Exam[Topic]# #Non-Law Background Law Master's[Topic]# #23 Law Background Law Master's[Topic]# #Law Background Law Master's[Topic]# #23 Graduate Entrance Exam[Topic]# #Second Attempt Graduate Entrance Exam[Topic]# #Law Master's[Topic]# #Law Master's in Law[Topic]# #24 Law Master's[Topic]# #Successful Admission[Topic]# #Law Master's Exam Preparation[Topic]# #Law Master's Exam Analysis[Topic]##24 Law Background Law Master's[Topic]##Graduate Entrance Exam Experience Sharing[Topic]# #24 Graduate Entrance Exam[Topic]#",

        "content": "Note Title: The Great Physician's Sincerity (Sun Simiao ‚Ä¢ Essential Prescriptions for Emergencies)\n    Note Content: A great physician treating sickness must first calm their mind and stabilize their spirit, free from desires or personal pursuits. They should first foster a great sense of compassion and pity, swearing to relieve all living beings from suffering. When someone seeks help for an illness, the physician must not inquire about their social status, wealth, age, appearance, relationship, nationality, or intelligence but treat everyone equally as if they were close relatives. They must not hesitate or consider personal gains and losses, nor fear for their own safety or life. Observing the suffering of others should be as if experiencing it themselves. With heartfelt sympathy, they must not avoid dangers, day or night, in cold or heat, or when hungry and fatigued, and must dedicate themselves wholeheartedly to the rescue without intentions of showing off their skills. Only then can one be considered a great physician for all living beings; otherwise, they are but a great thief robbing the life of sentient beings. Historically, virtuosos in medicine often sacrificed their own lives to save others in critical conditions. Although there are distinctions between the noble and the lowly, in the love for life, humans and animals are equal. Harming others to benefit oneself is against natural principles, especially with humanity. To seek survival through killing only distances one further from life. My prescriptions never use living beings as medicine for these reasons. If the marketplace has already-dead gadflies or leeches, they can be used due to prior death, exempting them from this category. As for an item like an unformed egg, which represents unmanifested potential, it should only be used in grave urgency and when there's no alternative. Avoiding its use is a virtue to strive for, though not everyone can achieve it. In cases dealing with unhealed wounds, severe diarrhea, or intolerably foul conditions that most people find repugnant, one must bring forth feelings of shame, grief, compassion, and empathy, suppressing the tiniest spark of disdain‚Äîthis is my intent.\n\t\nThe demeanor of a great physician requires purifying their spirit and maintaining a composed presence. A physician should present themselves with dignity, accessible yet reserved, neither overly radiant nor dim. They must deeply focus on diagnosing illnesses, meticulously observing symptoms and ensuring no details are overlooked. Prescriptions for needles and medicines must be precise, with no margin for error. Even though illnesses demand swift action, the physician must remain clear-headed, thoroughly reflective, and never act rashly or flaunt their skills out of vanity, craving fame. This would be deeply unethical! Furthermore, when visiting patients even in lavish settings filled with luxurious silks and music, they must remain indifferent to such distractions. Exquisite delicacies might be served, yet they should act as if tasteless. Although rare wines may be offered, they must behave as if unaware of their presence. The reasoning is simple: When one suffers, the room is joyless for all, especially for the suffering patient. A physician delighting in leisure amidst this is shameful in the eyes of humanity and divinity alike. True sages would never conduct themselves this way, for it goes against the core principles of medicine.\n\t\nIn practicing medicine, one should avoid excessive speaking, joking, or making frivolous noises. Gossiping about right and wrong, discussing people, boasting of one‚Äôs fame, or disparaging fellow physicians is unacceptable. Praising oneself while discrediting others and becoming arrogant after curing one case, believing oneself unmatched under the heavens‚Äîthis is the fatal flaw of physicians.\n\t\nLaozi said, 'When one practices positive virtues, others will reward them; practicing hidden virtues brings rewards from spirits and deities. Practicing evident evils results in self-punishment, while hidden evils invite harm from spirits.' Therefore, physicians should not rely on their expertise to exploit their advantage solely for material gain but should focus on alleviating suffering. In doing so, they naturally attract blessings from the ethereal realm. Additionally, they must not prescribe rare and expensive medicines to the wealthy just to flaunt their abilities, forcing patients into hardship. This would be contrary to loyalty and compassion. With a heart oriented toward salvation, I elaborate on these guidelines, encouraging students not to disdain plain words or lowly expressions.\n#TraditionalChineseMedicine[topic]# #MedicalEthics[topic]#",

Initially, I started watching the show because of Nam Joo-hyuk's looks, and the visuals in the trailer were stunning. The male lead with long legs, fair skin, and a youthful yet mature vibe‚Äîat first glance, the female lead didn't seem like a good match for him.\n\t\nOnly after finishing the show did I realize the essence of the drama lies in the casting of the female lead. She is truly üçê Hee-do herself. Energetic, funny, hot-tempered, kind, and career-driven‚Äîa little sun that no one can resist loving [WowR]\n\t\nA friend said that youth-themed dramas are overdone, yet this one still became overwhelmingly popular, undoubtedly because of its unique charm. I think it captured the core essence of youth films‚Äîloud friends, passionate love, reachable dreams, and an era that won't abandon you as long as you refuse to quit...\n\t\nThe writer tells us that youth is fleeting and passionate. In youth, we are both poor and rich. It seems like we can't afford anything yet can own this free and exclusive summer of ours [RedHeartR]\n\t\nWhile I was moved by the noisy, heartfelt, and passionate youth of the characters, the writer used an incomprehensible approach to make me truly grasp the essence of youth‚Äîgrowth and loss. Two people who gave each other strength eventually drifted apart on the road of growth... It seems that most couples go through such a stage, where love becomes a heavier burden. Some couples, through mutual effort and compromise, manage to stay together, while others, after trying, decide to let go of each other.\n\t\nIn the drama, Hee-do initiates the breakup and tells him, 'We only love each other when things are going well.' This is the part about Hee-do that I can't get over. At that moment, I marveled at how brave she was to propose a separation to someone who walked through youth with her. Despite clearly loving him so much, when the love ceased to be a source of strength for both, she rationally suggested separating. Just like Hee-do said in the show, 'It also takes great courage to give up.' Sometimes, giving up requires more courage than holding on!\n\t\nReflecting back, Hee-do is truly an amazing and cool girl! In love, she actively pursues what she likes and doesn't feel regretful about rejection. During the relationship, she understands what she truly needs, knowing when to hold on and when to let go. Always shining and warming those around her, Hee-do has always loved others well and loved herself well. The energy she gave me has also made me braver. We must strive to become girls like Hee-do!\n\t\nYouth is noisy and passionate, within reach yet gradually out of reach. We can't hold onto it nor take it with us. It may even slowly be buried beneath the passage of time, but none of that diminishes its beauty! It will forever be the most dazzling existence [RoseR][CherryBlossomR][CherryBlossomR]",

There are many videos online about the German alphabet, and you can learn along with them. A good way to remember German letters is to use the pronunciation of German letters to remember German brand abbreviations, for example, DB: Deutsche Bahn, the German railway company.\n\n2 Mastering Pronunciation Rules\n\nGerman is a very regular language, with many fixed pronunciation combinations such as: eu, au, ei, ch, sch, tsch. Remembering them can make learning twice as effective.\n\n3 Understanding German Grammar Structure\n\nHere, I suggest everyone watch online videos together with a grammar book. The grammar book I used before was 'New Intensive German Grammar and Exercises' from Tongji University's Preparatory Department for Studying in Germany.\n\n4 Watching Videos Suitable for German Beginners\n\nGerman has a total of 6 levels, with A1 and A2 being beginner levels. Actually, on various video platforms, if you search for keywords like German beginner or German A1, you can easily find some videos.\n\n5 Watching Videos About German Culture\n\nLanguage learning is definitely not independent of cultural learning, but during the beginner phase, due to limited language proficiency, it's hard to watch purely German videos to understand German culture. However, cultural learning helps us better understand the logic within the language, and also makes language learning more vivid. The blogger I recommend has videos with manually translated subtitles, and based on my experience in Germany, she talks about the most typical examples of life in Germany. Each video segment is about one or two minutes, and you can spend a little time each day learning something.\n\n6 Joining Language Learning Communities to Find Study Partners\n\nSelf-study can be short-lived, so you can find fellow German learners online. I often come across some on Xiaohongshu.\n\n7 Regularly Testing Personal Proficiency\n\nAfter studying for a period and feeling confident, you can test your proficiency. The traditional way to certify A1 is to take the Goethe-Institut A1 exam.\n\n#One-on-One German Learning",

The game is similar to 'Overcooked', where all players are members of the Bellflower team, working together to serve meals to guests. As long as the guests' requirements are met and the last VIP guest card is completed, the players can win together. If orders are not completed during the game, complaint tokens will be received. If 3 complaint tokens are obtained or there are no new guest cards to replenish on the table before completing the last VIP guest card, the players lose together.\n\t\n     It seems like the game might be a bit difficult, and might even make everyone chaotic, but in fact, as long as there is some prior communication, orders can be completed quickly. Even if orders are not completed and complaints are received, there's no need to worry. Receiving complaints will reset the meal tokens in the current player's hand, which might lead to more compliant meals appearing. Moreover, when completing orders, we can also choose to rotate the hourglass or ask the butler for help, both of which can effectively help us complete orders. Couples, parents and children, team-building activities can all try this game to enhance our mutual collaboration skills. And the game itself is not difficult, even if it gets chaotic, work together to overcome challenges! #BoardGame[Topic]# #PartyBoardGameRecommendation[Topic]# #GameDaily[Topic]# #Overcooked[Topic]# #PartyGame[Topic]#",

I thought we had a pretty good relationship. Recently, the company had a letter to send to a client, but the client‚Äôs number was invalid, so I asked the courier to sign for it first. However, the courier said someone had to pick it up in person because it was a document. \nI asked my college classmate to help pick it up. We had agreed on it, but since last Thursday till today, I haven't received a reply. The courier called me today, saying tomorrow is the last day; if no one picks it up, it will be returned.\nShe wasn‚Äôt like this during college. Later, I asked a dormmate about it. My dormmate asked me to think about what kind of person she was in college. She mentioned that, back then, people in her class didn‚Äôt like her. Surprisingly, the most arrogant classmate in her class was polite to her. She explained at that time that it was because she was the assistant class monitor, and the teacher treated her well, so her classmates thought she often reported them, which made them dislike her. Because of this, during the senior year when she was alone in her dorm room, she said she was scared and asked me to move in to accompany her. My dormmates didn‚Äôt agree with that. Now, my dormmates have summed up their thoughts, saying she‚Äôs not a bad person, just a delicate egoist. #Feeling a bit complicated [Topic]# #College Classmate [Topic]# #College Dorm [Topic]# #University Hostel [Topic]#",

I put it in sanitary pants and even changed to a smart water tank so it could always drink warm water. But I feel that my dog's behavior this time is different from before!\nPreviously, when my dog was in heat, I would take it downstairs for a walk and sunbathe, but this time the dog didn't want to go downstairs and seemed very lethargic, sleeping with its tail drooping all day, not even enthusiastic about eating! Sometimes it seemed very anxious, restless, and wouldn't let me rub its stomach. I asked a friend at the pet clinic, and he said that every girl's constitution is different, some have dysmenorrhea, some don't, and it's the same for dogs. My dog should be experiencing dysmenorrhea. After hearing this, I felt both amused and annoyed. So dogs can have dysmenorrhea too. I asked my dog if it had dysmenorrhea, and it actually gave me a dirty look!! Never mind, I forgive it since it's obviously uncomfortable now.\n\nI got a hot water bottle and placed it next to its stomach, thinking that I usually take Leonurus granules to relieve pain when I'm in heat, so I searched online and found a treatment for dogs with dysmenorrhea called Yimu Gui Beef Tablets, the main ingredient of which is also Leonurus. It can activate blood and resolve stasis, warm the meridians, and stop pain, relieving the pain when the dog is in heat. I quickly bought a few boxes for my dog. I crushed them and mixed them into the dog food. After a few days, I noticed that my dog's mental state had significantly improved! It became enthusiastic about eating again and willing to go downstairs to sunbathe.\nFamily members are really funny hahaha! So dogs can also have stomach pain when in heat! Useful knowledge has increased again! It's just tough on my dog.\n\n#Dog#Dog in Heat#Dog Dysmenorrhea#Dysmenorrhea#Dog Care Experience Sharing",

Is this typhoon severe?\nThis typhoon is rated as Level I, which is a typhoon that cannot be ignored, but the specific impact level needs to be determined by the typhoon's path and the final wind speed formed at sea. Currently, Dongshan rarely experiences significant typhoon impacts; during the Morandi incident, Dongshan was quiet and unaffected. Of course, we should not rely on luck; tourists in Dongshan should not wander around.\n2. Will the typhoon still be there if I come on July 29th or in August?\nTyphoons will rage for a few hours after landing but not for days. There may be one or two days of showers and overcast skies after the typhoon, which also depends on the impact after the typhoon lands.\n3. When will the next typhoon come?\nTyphoon formation cannot be predicted in advance; it can only be judged after it forms.\n4. Can I come in August?\nAugust still has mostly good weather; Dongshan with its blue sky, white clouds, blue sea, and sandy beaches welcomes you. If guests are coming on July 29th, there might be some showers, but it could also clear up immediately. However, the typhoon will be gone, and currently, the message received is that the high-speed rail will open on the 29th.\n5. Can we go to the sea after the typhoon?\nIt is not recommended for the first few days. After the typhoon, there is a lot of trash on the beach, and the wave conditions are unclear; safety is important.\n\t\n6. How will the weather be like in the half-month after the typhoon?\nWe cannot predict the weather that far ahead; we can only judge the weather for the next few days based on today's weather. After all, weather forecasts are not always accurate, but in August, there is actually not much rain.\n#If there are other questions, feel free to ask, and I will answer if I know\n#B&B Recommendation [Topic]# #B&B Recommendation [Topic]# #South Gate Bay of Dongshan Island [Topic]# #Typhoon [Topic]# #Zhangzhou Dongshan Island [Topic]#",

        "content": "Note Title: Bought 28 Projectors in Full Payment, How to Save Money to the Extreme, Q&A\n    Note Content: If it works well, I'll write a recommendation post. If it doesn't, I'll write a warning post.\n\t\nAfter careful selection, I chose a certain brand, mainly because I was impressed by the designer. The details were done very well, such as only making three drawers for the TV cabinet and leaving two spaces for flipping out to store the router. For example, almost all handles were removed, slanted inner edges were made, and the top plate was recessed without showing impatience. The composition and contrasting colors are important to me too, unlike designers from certain brands who just know how to copy.\n\t\nHow to save money on whole-house customization? Here's the practical guide:\n[One R] Reduce full-height doors:\nFor every fewer full-height door, you save on a straightener, rebounder, or handle, at least 200 yuan. Except for the TV wall, divided wardrobe doors are more convenient!\n[Two R] Maximize the free offerings:\nWhatever is free from the brand you like, make full use of it! If they offer free drawers based on projection areas, then go all out ‚Äî each drawer saves over 200 yuan, stuff them in the wardrobe! If rebounders can be upgraded to rebound wheels, then skip the handles! The slanted inner cut in my choice was free, so I retained only four handles, the rest were done with inner cuts. Other brands charge 100 yuan per meter or 75 yuan per meter, and I saved at least 2,000 yuan on all handles!\n[Three R] Avoid excessive LED strips and glass doors:\nI feel LED strips are unnecessary except for photos. Do you still watch TV with the cabinet underlights on? It's too dazzling. They typically charge 500-800 yuan for a strip plus a transformer. If you really need them at home, DIY is cheaper! An induction LED strip for the entrance or dining sideboard is practical enough for daily life! As for glass doors, think about the organization behind them. If they're completely blacked-out glass, it might be better to go with regular door panels! In no time, they'll just become fingerprint collectors. Besides, adding 500-600 yuan per square meter isn't necessary.\n[Four R] Don't do PET unless necessary:\nKorean LG (LX) skin texture is excellent, but the double-sided surface doesn't fall short either! The main issue is fingerprints! Greasy handprints ‚Äì after a couple of touches, it's all the same. Instead, choose a nice color! This saves at least 140 yuan per square meter!\n[Five R] Bargain:\nDon't worry about packages. First, calculate based on the promotional offers, then negotiate on add-ons. Ask for discounts from the manager, then get some giveaways in the end.\n[Six R] Don't overlook service and after-sales:\nThe attitude, quality, and responsiveness of the service providers and the designer are crucial throughout the process. I chose this brand because they allowed contract add-ons, created a project service group, and provided lifetime warranty. This was one of the key reasons they beat small studios in the final decision.\n[Seven R] Destiny Matters!\nVery important! Even if your friend's recommendation is great, it might not suit you. Pur, ENF, laminate boards, and so on are widely known now. What's more important is the connection ‚Äî if it doesn't feel right, don't force it. Otherwise, there could be more chaos later.\n\t\nFinally, looking forward to the results in 60 days!\nHope it doesn‚Äôt go wrong. After all, in the end, our whole family drew lots and chose this one!\n#WholeHouseCustomization[Topic]# #WholeHouseCustomizationFactory[Topic]# #WholeHouseCustomFurniture[Topic]# #WholeHouseCustomCabinetsWardrobes[Topic]# #HighEndWholeHouseCustomization[Topic]# #ChangchunRealEstate[Topic]# #ChangchunSecondHandHouse[Topic]#",

They complement each other, jointly constructing a complete system of military strategy.\n.\nWhy should we read military books?\n.\nüçÄThose who have watched the TV series 'Crazy Speed' know that Gao Qiqiang, through reading 'The Art of War', grasped its essence and successfully turned his life around, speeding through life's journey.\n.\nüçÄIn ancient times, Cao Cao and Li Shimin said, 'I have read many military books and strategies, but Sun Wu's work is profound.' Today, figures like Mao Zedong, Sun Yat-sen, and even entrepreneurs like Jack Ma have benefited deeply from it.\n.\nClearly, reading military books is not just about learning to lead troops in battle, but more about learning the way of dealing with people and integrating the knowledge into our lives, studies, and work.\n.\nüìöThe 'New Interpretation Series of Chinese Classics: The Art of War and Thirty-Six Stratagems' provides a classic interpretation of these two extraordinary military books, covering aspects like topic explanation, original text, annotations, translations, and analysis.\n.\nMany people often confuse these two military books, but after reading this book, they can clearly understand the differences. Essentially, the difference lies in the 'stratagem'. In 'The Thirty-Six Stratagems', 'stratagem' refers to specific operational methods and tactics in combat, with most of the thirty-six stratagems being well-known folk sayings. 'The Art of War' emphasizes both strategy and strong foundational strength, highlighting the organic combination and dialectical unity of power and intelligence.\n.\nLet's introduce these two military books separately.\n\nüìö'The Art of War', written by Sun Wu in the 5th century BC, has been circulating for over 2000 years. The book is divided into thirteen chapters: 'Initial Estimates', 'Waging War', 'Strategic Attack', 'Dispositions', 'Forces', 'Weaknesses and Strengths', 'Maneuvering', 'Variations', 'Marching', 'Terrain', 'Nine Varieties of Ground', 'Fire Attacks', and 'Espionage', totaling about six thousand words. This is a complete military strategy that can be applied not only in military affairs but also in corporate management and daily life.\n\nüìö'The Thirty-Six Stratagems' mostly appear in popular literature from the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, and the book was likely compiled no earlier than the late Ming Dynasty, possibly during the Qing Dynasty. It is not divided into volumes but consists of six sets, each containing six stratagems, totaling thirty-six stratagems. 'The Thirty-Six Stratagems' extols stratagems, with each stratagem containing content mostly from ancient military strategists' cunning plans, making it a book focused on military tactics.\n\nThese two military books, one focusing on strategy and the other on stratagems, complement each other perfectly. This one book allows you to master both, especially with its detailed annotations, making it more accessible.\n.\nRead more military books, learn from ancient wisdom, absorb the wisdom of dealing with people, enhance your leadership skills, and you could be the next Gao Qiqiang.\n#Sharing Good Books[Topic]# #Book List[Topic]# #The Art of War and Thirty-Six Stratagems[Topic]# #The Art of War[Topic]#",

The protagonist was betrayed, which felt undeserved. Although her death was accidental, it indeed stemmed from neglecting her disciples, not realizing one might grow resentful out of love and hatred. The disciple who killed the master was extremely foolish since the protagonist had given them meticulous emotional care but was still manipulated by others. The story has minimal romance; only in the middle does the male lead gain clarity on his feelings, starting his pursuit of the female protagonist.",

[Strong][Strong]\nThe place was also easy to find.\n Address: Original Cosmos Immersive Theater (72 Pipa Mountain Main Street, 340 meters ahead of Exit 2, Qixinggang Light Rail Station, inside Chongqing Cultural Relics and Archaeology Research Office)\nIt's just a short walk from Qixinggang subway station, very quick!\nWe followed the storyline of the second brother with friends.

One can‚Äôt help but admire how well-suited they are. Even if the second brother just stood there, you'd feel, 'So naive!' [Pig][Pig] But to be fair, he's the most handsome one.\nFirst-timers are recommended to follow the big brother or the chairman's wife. The second brother's story involves a romantic plotline [Smirk]. A must-try for a second visit! Once you've seen it, you'll understand. If you don't watch it a second time, you'll regret it [Love][Love][Love].\nThe cast's overall vibe was on point.

Especially in the heel area, a mirror-like leather material in the same color as the shoe body creates a sharp contrast in texture; equipped with a high-rebound comfortable insole printed with the ZERO word meaning 'starting from zero' and the brand logo, enhancing comfort; while the classic crepe sole provides anti-slip and wear-resistant functionality, adding a retro vibe.\n\nThe shoebox design is equally unique, inspired by Summer Jiahuan's collection of various shoeboxes. Each shoebox is like a pixel block, representing his identity as a collector, which becomes the inspiration for the shoebox's visual design.\n\t\nThe Kappa TIFO training shoes, co-created with Summer Jiahuan, will first launch on the Xiaohongshu Kappa Official Mall and SOLESTAGE Shanghai Flagship Store. Stay tuned!\n\t\n#TrendyShoes[Topic]# #XiaohongshuTrendEditingDept[Topic]# #TrendExpert[Topic]# #kappa[Topic]# #CollabSneakers[Topic]# @SummerJiahuanGREEN",

Multiple Tips for Freshmen\nSeptember is approaching soon, and many students have embarked on their new semester journey. Today, I'll share how course selection works in South Korean universities.\n\t\n1Ô∏è‚É£Pay Attention to School Official Website Announcements\nMost schools will post the course selection schedule on their official website two to three weeks to a month before the semester starts. It's usually a table listing the courses available for the semester, the credits for each course, and detailed information like the syllabus and the professor. A very humane aspect of South Korean universities is that there's a course adjustment period in the first week of the semester. After experiencing the first week of classes, if you find a course unsuitable, you can opt to drop or switch courses! (Trial Attendance - Drop/Switch)üìÖ\n2Ô∏è‚É£Everything for GPA!\nAttention Everyone! Always remember! Our ultimate goal in course selection is to achieve high scores and secure scholarships!\nEtch this into your bones! So, what can we do in advance to boost our GPA?üìöüíØ\n‚ñ∂Ô∏èCheck Professor Reviews in Advance[ Magnifying Glass R]\nIn school groups, inquire from seniors (about grading for Chinese students, amount of homework)\n‚ñ∂Ô∏èReview the Syllabusüìñ\nLearn to play to your strengths and avoid weaknesses. The course selection page usually publishes the syllabus for each course. This is very important!! Beyond telling you the course content, it's crucial to know if there's an exam; the weight of the exam; attendance requirements; and the amount of homework, all of which are indicated in the syllabus. Understanding these before selecting a course helps you decide whether to take it!üìù\n3Ô∏è‚É£Choose Professors Who Give High Scores or Strict Ones?\nIf you've already set your sights on furthering your studies and entering a top-tier university, you might consider choosing more courses that are easier to get an A or even an A+. But if you've decided on your future career path, you should select courses closely related to your major, choosing professors who are strict but offer substantial learning.\nUnderstanding the teaching style and academic direction of the professors ensures you don't miss out on academics and credits! Wishing everyone secures their preferred courses and enjoys the entire learning process. Full GPA!

Removing Yellow Tones is the Quick and Cost-Effective Way to Whiten Skin!\n    Note Content: Sisters struggling in vain for fairness, wake up... Don't blindly stick to one path without realizing itüò≠\nTry addressing the dull, rough, and yellowish skin by focusing on reducing yellow tones and brightening, and you'll naturally see the dawn of fair skin!!\n\t\n‚úÖBecause a yellowish, dull complexion like dirt can't escape these three demons:\n‚ù∂„ÄêGlycation„Äë‚ÜíAdvanced glycation end products (AGEs) accumulate in the epidermis, not only exacerbating skin yellowness but also making the skin brittle and dry, combined with free radicals destroying collagen and promoting loose fine lines\n\t\n‚ù∑„ÄêOxidation„Äë‚ÜíUnder the restless action of free radicals, it attacks cells, being the number one \"killer\" of dull skin\n‚ù∏„ÄêPhotoaging„Äë‚ÜíUltraviolet rays directly attack skin elasticity and luster, and also secretly accelerate deep skin aging\nThe corresponding approach is to counter these with a combination of highly effective ingredients‚úä, which is essential for effectively reducing yellow tones and brightening.\n-\nOlay's Anti-Glycation White Bottle has been a beacon for those with dull, yellowish skin for many years. Besides its signature niacinamide + acylcarnitine combination effectively inhibiting the wild growth of melanin and rapidly whitening the skin, it also acts like a solid force, building a strong wall of„Äêanti-glycation, anti-oxidation, anti-photoaging„Äë. I say it's not an overstatement to call it a dark, rough, yellow remover and a brightening miracleüôè!\n\t\nIn the fully confident anti-glycation aspect, üìñpublishing research data in scientific journals is the norm, aiming to shatter those ineffective anti-glycation theories. Olay's star ingredient, glycotin + 99.7% high-purity niacinamide, jointly attack the cause of skin yellowness‚ÄîAGEs, preventing them from hindering skin metabolism and protecting epidermal proteins from glycation;\n\t\nAdditionally, besides being recognized as a master at improving yellownessü§∫, niacinamide is also an underestimated ingredient that can improve the loss of elasticity, pigment spots, and fine lines caused by photoaging. Combined with panthenol, it effectively combats photoaging; for anti-oxidation, the classic antioxidants VC + VE tame free radicals and resist oxidative dullness.\n\t\nüëâAt least after using more than half a bottle, dealing with the yellowish, lifeless face after staying up late is a piece of cake. I can see the translucent and delicate texture of my face soaring, and the lustrous feeling in the side mirror is so strong[WowR]! Even in poor living conditions, it won't show on my face, who understands this serene, good complexion of the years??\nAnd it's great to use before makeup! My test shows that the pace of facial dullness has slowed down!\n\t\nAnyway, whether you're a tired worker with a wax-yellow face due to work and staying up late, or you want to pursue a more natural and translucent complexion, or you just love the practicality of one product doing the job of three‚Äîreducing yellow tones and brightening, just go for it[SlantEyeR]!\n#Reduce Yellow and Brighten[Topic]##Whitening Essence[Topic]# #Essence Recommendation[Topic]# #Anti-Glycation White Bottle[Topic]# #Anti-Oxidation[Topic]#",

Since ancient times, Qixi has always been shrouded in a dreamlike filter, laden with deep emotions and melancholy.\n\n    During the Tang Dynasty, Du Mu penned a quatrain expressing the loneliness of palace maidens: 'Silver candles cast cold light on the painted screen, a light silk fan gently sweeps fireflies. The night sky over the palace steps is as cool as water, lying down to watch the Weaver and the Cowherd stars.'\n\n    In the Song Dynasty, Qin Guan depicted the romantic meeting on the Magpie Bridge: 'A single encounter amidst golden wind and jade dew outweighs countless mundane meetings. If love lasts, why bother about the fleeting moments of dawn and dusk?'\n\n    The inherent romance in ancient souls is further highlighted on Qixi. In 'Six Records of a Floating Life,' Shen Fu described his daily life with his beloved wife, Yun, on Qixi, filled with deep affection and rituals.\n\n    Yun arranged incense and fruits, enjoying the cool with Shen Fu under the moonlight. Shen Fu even crafted a seal inscribed with 'Wishing to be husband and wife in all lifetimes,' which they used for their correspondence. The night was beautiful with the moonlight shimmering on the river like silk.\n\n    With just a few words, the idyllic scenery and profound love were vividly portrayed.\n\n    In 'Autumn Lights,' another Qing dynasty memoir, Jiang Tan recounted his marriage to his wife, Qiu, on Qixi. They reveled in joy under the candlelight, reminiscing about their playful antics in their youth.\n\n    Qiu later captured this magical night in her poem 'River Song: Remembering Qixi': 'Seventh night of the seventh month, weak and sickly. Amidst the feast, thoughts of separation weigh heavy. How can I pick up the needle and thread?'\n\n    Such talent and sentiment were admired even by Lin Yutang, who praised Qiu as one of the most endearing women in ancient China, alongside Yun from 'Six Records of a Floating Life.'\n\n    Besides these memoirs, many ancient texts beautifully depict love, transcending mere romance to touch the depths of human nature and fate.\n\n    This issue's book list includes five more titles that delve into the timeless theme of love.\n\n    #Reading #Qixi #Romance #Literature #BookRecommendation #ClassicalChineseLiterature",

        "content": "In June 2023 in Hangzhou. I used to be indifferent to the beauty of West Lake, until I heard a podcast where the host talked about his life in Hangzhou. He said that West Lake is open 24 hours a day, always waiting for you to visit. It doesn't charge an entrance fee, quietly situated in the center of the city. No matter the time, there are always people being healed by it on the shores of West Lake. This description moved me, so on a weekend in June, with the right opportunity, I took a day off from work and went to the West Lake mentioned in the podcast. Upon my first visit, West Lake was not as beautiful as I had imagined, but the surrounding greenery and parks were exceptionally well done. Near the Yintai area, there were many animals, with people feeding squirrels and sparrows, giving a sense of harmony between humans and nature. Later, I found that the beauty of West Lake lies in the fact that on the way to many different scenic spots, you can always see glimpses of it. When tired and looking for a place to sit, I always found West Lake right in front of me. The city seemed to be built around West Lake, with its ecology preserved exceptionally well. A clear lake is not as beautiful as a rainy lake, and a rainy lake is not as beautiful as a snowy lake. On the last day in Hangzhou, it rained, and I experienced the misty Jiangnan. By chance, I climbed a 'hill' along an alley, where there were many temples. I spent some time in quiet contemplation there. Before leaving, I bought a raincoat at a convenience store and rode along Hupao Road in the rain for a while, but gave up due to the heavy rain, which was a small regret of my Hangzhou trip. Finally, I ordered a drink at a local tavern and bid farewell to the city in the misty rain.",

Today, I'll share some small tips on Xunpu floral hairpins. Tip 1: Choose Flowers. From Yingbao and Xiaotong's heads, you can see beautiful flower arrangements, many small flowers on top, and also on both sides, the area must be large and full to look prettier. Clothing should preferably be local fisherwomen attire, horse-face skirts, cheongsams, and other Hanfu, while Nyonya attire is not suitable for photoshoots at Mazu temples. Tip 2: Shooting Location. Ancestral halls, banyan trees, and Southern Fujian ancient houses are good choices. Tip 3: Time. Try to avoid the strong midday light, as it's too hard and not soft enough. Tip 4: Props. Fans, bamboo hats, oil umbrellas, bamboo baskets, and kites are all good choices (you can find professional photographers who have everything, saving you trouble). #Xunpu Women Floral Hairpins [Topic]##Xunpu Women [Topic]# ##Quanzhou Photoshoot [Topic]# #Xiamen Photoshoot [Topic]# #Xunpu Women Photoshoot [Topic]# #Boyfriend Photographer Training [Topic]# #Xunpu Shooting [Topic]# #Xunpu Mazu [Topic]#",

Efficient memorization: Record your understanding with a voice recorder, listen repeatedly to deepen memory. Memorization learning can utilize a voice recorder for recording, avoid using the phone, the voice recorder has clearer sound quality and can be used for repeated listening in the morning and before bedtime, making the memory more solid. Initially, you can record by knowledge points or modules, and when you start memorizing, choose a morning or an afternoon for memorization. Use a countdown loop 2-3 times, each cycle 50 minutes for recording and reciting, rest for 10 minutes, look at the big trees, blue sky, and white clouds outside, take a few deep breaths, try not to look at social media, and give yourself 20 minutes to check the phone after the cycle is complete. After recording, play back at double speed to find deficiencies, and circle the areas where you get stuck in your notes... Kading Cat voice recorder is compact and cute!

It paints a beautiful picture, telling of the valuable life lessons about the fleeting nature of beauty and art that the author learned from her grandfather, while also showcasing the author's image as a keen observer of nature and humanity. ü¶ã One of the challenges in writing an essay about someone who has influenced you is to ensure that while describing that person, you still keep the focus on yourself and your own growth. In this example, Michelle successfully captures the essence of her grandfather, a knowledgeable and versatile man who understands the fleeting nature of butterflies and also sympathizes with Michelle's concern for them. üé® At the same time, the article maintains its focus on Michelle's growth over the years. She inherited her love for nature from her grandfather, as well as the ability to record her insights and introspection about life. We also see her artistic talent, as she describes her butterfly wing art as a way to preserve natural beauty. üë¥ The article establishes a beautiful contrast between her grandfather's aging and their early lessons in catching butterflies. A particularly striking part of the article is her recognition of her grandfather's changes when she finally sees him nine years later. The article sets up a beautiful contrast between her grandfather's aging and the early lessons about the fleeting nature of butterflies. It reminds her of how short life is, cleverly paving the way for her concluding realization that creating new memories is the main lesson her grandfather tried to impart to her. ‚ú® Overall, although the focus of this article is on Michelle's grandfather and his influence on her, we still learn a lot about Michelle. We know she is very talented, has artistic flair, and cares deeply about others. Her thoughtful and introspective nature is also evident in this article, which is undoubtedly a quality that attracts admissions officers. #AmericanHighSchool[Topic] #AmericanUndergraduate[Topic] #StudyAbroad[Topic] #StudyintheUSA[Topic] #StudyAbroadStories[Topic] #StudyAbroadApplicationSeason[Topic] #ApplicationEssay[Topic] #Essay[Topic] #Writing[Topic] #WritingSkills[Topic] #IELTS[Topic]. @KnowledgePotato @CampusPotato",

It's that time again when U.S. universities compete with each other, and international students secretly compare rankings~. It has to be said, no matter how the gods fight, the giants will always be giants. Unsurprisingly, the nation's Top 1 remains the unshakable Princeton University, which has produced 69 Nobel laureates and stood firm for 13 consecutive years as the elder brother of the Ivy League. MIT is also not messing around, still firmly holding the second place throne. Tied for third place are Harvard University and Stanford University. Fifth place goes to Yale University, sixth to the University of Pennsylvania, and tied for seventh are Duke University and Caltech. The University of Pennsylvania has risen to just behind HYPSM!‚ù§Ô∏è. There are three tied for ninth place, namely Brown University, Johns Hopkins, and Northwestern University. As is well known, the TOP10 in the national rankings is extremely crowded every year, and it's easy to be left out of the TOP10. So Cornell and the University of Chicago were directly pushed to 12th place. This time, UCLA and Berkeley don't need to argue about who is first and who is second, as both schools are tied for 15th place. The 17th place goes to Rice University, and 18th to Dartmouth College and Vanderbilt University, with Notre Dame University ranking 20th! This year, the most impressive are the UC system universities, with UC Davis and UCSD ranking 28th respectively. See the full TOP60 list in the image. NYU and USC both fell, with NYU dropping out of the top 30, and UNC entering the T25!üêÇ.

In the winter of 2015, three sisters planned to visit Wuzhen together during the Spring Festival holiday when there were many tourists. The owner of the homestay we encountered was a kind-hearted person who picked us up from the Wuzhen Bus Station and took us to Dongzha. He suggested we visit Dongzha first and then go to Xizha in the afternoon to see the night view. During our conversation, he mentioned that there is a Taoyuan Town in Suzhou, very close to Wuzhen, just a ten-minute drive away, which made me feel closer to Wuzhen and look forward to seeing the dreamy Peach Blossom Land. [Atmospheric R]. Walking down Dongzha Street, it started to rain, and every scenic spot was crowded. Passing over each bridge, I had no time to enjoy the scenery, just being pushed along by the crowd. This was completely different from the leisurely old streets seen in the TV drama 'Like Water and Time', and I lost the interest to visit Xizha, wanting only to escape. This dream-seeking trip to Wuzhen left me disappointed. [Atmospheric R]. Now, looking back, I remember passing by Mu Xin's former residence, looking up at the dark bronze doorplate, just walking by, at that time I didn't know Mr. Mu Xin... #Wuzhen [Topic]# #Like Water and Time [Topic]# #Ancient Town [Topic]# #Jiangnan [Topic]# #Memory [Topic]# #Travel Story [Topic]#",

        "content": "D8 A Perfect Day in Kyoto! Today is the last full day in Kyoto. I planned to visit Kiyomizu Temple early in the morning, but felt a bit tired (and hungry), so I bought a nail clipper at a convenience store and went back to the hotel for breakfast. Japanese elementary students in the early morning are very energetic [LaughR][LaughR]. After breakfast, sleepiness hit me, and I unexpectedly fell asleep for an hour in the room... Then I went out to Fushimi Inari Taisha with full energy. It turns out that the grand shrine is on Mount Inari... So, as expected, I thought 'since I'm here already'... The sky was also cooperative, showing a clear 'Grass Mud Horse' cloud hhh. Fortunately, Mount Inari is not very high, about 228 meters it seems. After descending, I ate a green grilled rice cake and exclaimed 'oh my', although I still haven't figured out why it's green, it feels like it's mixed with mugwort. On the way down, I encountered a napping wildcat, very obedient and let me pet it, but I didn't... As soon as I got down the mountain, it suddenly started to rain, the kind that pours cats and dogs, luckily I not only have a big head but also an umbrella. I thought about going back to the hotel to change clothes, but since it was raining, it wasn't necessary, so I headed straight to Kyoto University. PD-1 has a significant impact and might even benefit me, so I stood and admired it for a while, but didn't bow hhh. The geographical relationship between the Medical School and the affiliated hospital of Kyoto University is the same as that of Peking University Medical School and its Third Hospital, door to door, which made me nostalgic for a moment... The graduate school and the hospital are about the same size... In the evening, I had tofu kaiseki cuisine. How should I put it, Japanese cuisine is indeed a feast for the eyes, very beautiful, and Kyoto's tofu is very tender (eating too much causes bloating, so I was turbocharging all the way back...). Anyway, today is a perfect day, wrapping up Kansai and invading Tokyo! #Japanese Travel[Topic]# #Kansai Travel[Topic]# #Kyoto[Topic]# #Kyoto Travel[Topic]#",

Though only eight caves, shocking with regret, regret with excitement, excitement naturally leading to emotion and reflection... The novelty and beauty of the Buddhist realm, bold and stunning color coordination, smooth lines like flowing water and rolling clouds. The charm of the figures and the entire scene is not superficial but penetrates from within, deeply peaceful and full. The sophisticated and profound aesthetic taste of our ancestors, rich in texture and connotation; steady and bold, advanced craftsmanship; the 'transformation' presents evidence of the prosperity of ancient times, the inscriptions and paintings are another solid proof of glory... The hardships, ignorance, helplessness, and regret of the unknown Wang Daoist... Just like my study room where all my belongings and little treasures are hidden, one day the door is wide open, strangers are picking and choosing my treasures, packing them into several large bags. Those are treasures with emotional value to me alone, they must feel lonely and lost in someone else's home, missing their roots... The 'blush of shame' wiped by the descendants in 'See Dunhuang Again', wipe it on! The 'blush' is a confession to our ancestors, and more so an encouragement to the current and future generations to develop the economy, revitalize and develop culture, guide the younger generation to build cultural confidence, make wishes and strive to reclaim our 'ancient civilization'... Lagging behind leads to being beaten. Lagging behind leads to ignorance. Now the country plans comprehensively, regulates 'capital', and drives common prosperity... Now President Xi emphasizes cultural revitalization. Strong spirit, unified belief... Now promoting President Xi's 'Belt and Road'. Overcoming all difficulties to 'reopen' the Silk Road land route that our ancestors 'opened', no longer being controlled by the sole sea route. Strong economy! The first intimate soft step and touch of the vast and ever-changing desert, don't indulge in its motherly soft embrace for hundreds of miles, but it can also laughingly take you into its arms at any time to return to life... A crystal-quality crescent pendant embedded in the endless yellow sand... In the temple rebuilt after destruction, the master talked to me, asking where I came from... The master talked about the magnetic field, then about Jiuhua Mountain, I talked to the master about materialism, including philosophy, and being good... The cultural roots journey of the 'Hexi Corridor', listening to the gentle voice of a thousand-year-old man, telling the story... The vast and peaceful northwest, tender yet resilient...

Generally, cotton and linen are fine, providing both comfort and meeting needs.. 3. Fit. Choose dropped shoulders for a relaxed fit, or regular shoulders for a neat look, depending on personal preference..

Now everyone is talking about being Buddhist-style, lying flat, which reminds me of Shen Mei Zhuang in the TV series 'Legends of Zhen Nuang'. She is the true representative of the Buddhist-style.\t„ÄÇ.\t„ÄÇShen Mei Zhuang's Buddhist-style has two characteristics: first, she is good at changing places to strive.\t„ÄÇ.\t„ÄÇShe once said to Zhen Huan: I know I am not as talented as you, nor as beautiful, so I decided to cultivate virtue and strive for being virtuous. You are good at dancing, so I focus on playing the qin, and I have never been inferior to you.\t„ÄÇ.\t„ÄÇFrom the beginning, she knew how to play to her strengths and avoid her weaknesses. This ensures that she is never inferior to Zhen Huan, so on the surface, she seems very Buddhist-style, not at all jealous that the other person is more talented and beautiful, and better at dancing than her.\t„ÄÇ.\t„ÄÇIn fact, she has achieved results in other fields, so there is no need to be jealous of people in another field. Just like, as a writer, I definitely won't be jealous of singers. In singing, I will appear extremely Buddhist-style.\t„ÄÇ.\t„ÄÇLater, Shen Mei Zhuang gave up being the emperor's favorite concubine, realizing that this path was not suitable for her and was very risky. She also chose to change fields, not striving for the emperor, but for the empress dowager.\t„ÄÇ.\t„ÄÇBesides changing fields to strive, the reason Mei Zhuang is so calm is that she doesn't value the results that much.\t„ÄÇ.\t„ÄÇShe once said to Wen Shichu: You, a big man, how can you become so nagging. If you like her, it doesn't matter if she likes you or not, you just need to stick to your own heart. If you don't like her anymore, just let it go, why make yourself so haggard and ugly, and be laughed at by others.\t„ÄÇ.\t„ÄÇActually, this is also what she said to herself. She had a crush on Wen Shichu, but she always cared more about the process than the outcome.\t„ÄÇ.\t„ÄÇI think Shen Mei Zhuang's 'Buddhist-style view' is relatively healthy.\t„ÄÇ.\t„ÄÇIt's not really Buddhist-style. In life, there are too many things to protect and too many things to want, so it's impossible to be completely Buddhist-style. However, we can be Buddhist-style in places we don't care much about, and strive in other places. For example, be a bit Buddhist-style in life, and a bit more striving at work. Be a bit Buddhist-style in interpersonal relationships, and a bit more striving in personal skills.\t„ÄÇ.\t„ÄÇAnd, just strive for the process, don't care so much about the results. Because no one can predict the results, but generally speaking, if the process is done well, the results won't be bad either.\t„ÄÇ¬†¬†#Note Inspiration[Topic]#¬†¬†#Happy Moments in Daily Life[Topic]#¬†¬†#My Writing Routine[Topic]#¬†¬†#Zhen Huan[Topic]#¬†¬†#Famous Scenes in Zhen Huan[Topic]#",

Measuring whether the other person loves you or not can instantly drop a person into a low dimension and low energy. Yesterday's experience was really terrible. Fortunately, after studying for so long, I still have a quick recovery ability. I can recover as usual in the morning, send the child, pick up the child, and then ponder that heaven gives me free time, so I should efficiently accompany the child. Marriage has countless times made me want to give up, but the existence of my child has made me strive countless times to repair and progress. Because countless teachers have told us that relationships are mirrors. When you think someone else has a problem, what you see is yourself. Changing yourself is much easier than changing others. I want to become a better person. Starting with self-care, both intimate relationships and parent-child relationships will become more harmonious and comfortable. The process of being aware of my emotions is repetitive. I don't judge myself, I allow myself to feel down, and I am willing and able to face everything that happens. Life will be invincible.",

Initially, I thought of having my mom take care of him while I go to work. After about two months of living together, I realized that you can't have your cake and eat it too. I really can't tolerate my mom's personality; we are very incompatible and not suitable for living together long-term. We have a washing machine at home, but she insists on hand washing. The breakfast is always boiled eggs and blended porridge from the food processor, which I really dislike. Whenever I say something she doesn't like, she rolls her eyes, and seeing that look makes me not want to talk to her anymore. Who understands! No matter what I say, she never gives me positive feedback. For example, if something really annoys me, my mom would say, 'What's there to be annoyed about.' Who understands, this just makes me even more annoyed! Also, since my mom came, my son's temper has visibly worsened. Whenever I try to discipline him, my mom would say he's still young, blah blah. Or if my son doesn't eat properly, my mom would say, 'Your mom is going to get angry and spank you later...' So, how can I make her stop taking care of my child now? I'm afraid to say it directly because I don't want to hurt her feelings, and it's driving me crazy every day... #Parent-Child Relationship [Topic]# #Child Education [Topic]#",

        "content": "[Translation Serial 20/22] FQA (6/6). 13. I always ask myself how to achieve extraordinary accomplishments (Leo's note: I think this question is related to a previously published article about Warren Buffett, who is considered one of the most successful investors today). Do I need to surround myself with other successful people? Make friends with them? How do I find satisfaction in a field where it's hard to achieve harmony because everyone has different egos. Here in New York, in Queens, people seem to be paranoid, and it's hard to get close to each other. And these people label others as 'crazy' or other tags. People keep their distance from each other, as if they don't need life experiences. Answer: You should surround yourself with positive energy people who can support you, inspire you, and tolerate the changes you make... This really helps. Build friendships and trust, make yourself trustworthy, sincerely want to help others, and be the best in your field... These will also benefit you. If you are in an environment where people keep their distance, being friendly will make you stand out, which can bring many difficulties to your existence. You can change your environment (e.g., I moved from Guam to San Francisco for many reasons), or you can build an online support group where you are not limited by the people around you in the physical environment. I believe that as long as you are kind, compassionate, and helpful, you will also find people like yourself around you, even if most people will criticize you (it's not a big deal). 14. I am thinking about how to find satisfaction when busy like a student before a final exam. How to find satisfaction when facing difficult choices like leaving loved ones, studying abroad, or studying locally. Answer: You can have both busyness and satisfaction. Satisfaction comes only from being happy and content with yourself and your life, so you can find happiness and contentment while studying, taking exams, or even when very busy. It will still be hard to make tough choices, even if you have satisfaction yourself. The key is to be satisfied with your decision after you make it, let go of the worry that you might make a wrong decision, and then focus on how the decision works for you and learn from the process. 15. How to go with the flow... especially when things are not going smoothly. (I want to say how to make life more smooth... actually, the need for stimulation has become a norm in my life for a long time). Answer: We are always addicted to past mental habits, such as wanting stimulation or emotional 'roller coasters', or equating happiness with stimulation, so when you do this often, you get used to it. I'm glad you realize all this, because many people can't even recognize this problem. Nevertheless, we can actually let go of these mental habits, as long as we have awareness and practice repeatedly. When everything is going well, focus on appreciating the beauty of this peace, rather than wanting the stimulation or surprises you were used to. When you find yourself expecting stimulation, observe it, and then return to appreciating what you already have, this requires repeated practice.",

Last night while walking the dog, because of a hypothetical question, my partner got angry, and I feel the divergence in our values is getting bigger. My dog Kele has a bad temper and is often fierce to people who are not me, baring its teeth, somewhat taking advantage of my presence. My partner really dislikes Kele, but whenever we go out for a walk, he always wants to pet Kele. If Kele growls softly, he gets angry and will kick Kele while walking. Overall, the interaction is not harmonious, and he always expresses his dislike for it. Then yesterday, he asked me a hypothetical question, saying if we have a child in the future and Kele bites the child, and then he gets bitten while disciplining Kele, what should I do. I said it's impossible; with a child, I wouldn't let Kele live with us. My answer upset him, implying that I should say I would put Kele down. But from my perspective, Kele is a dog that has been with me for over nine years. Despite its many flaws, I still love it very much. It comforts me by rubbing against me when I'm emotional and crying, it greets me every day when I come home, and it accompanied me through the lonely days of working away from home alone. I've already compromised by saying we won't live together in the future, but he still insists I choose between him and the dog, which is really frustrating.

The heaviest I've been was almost 220 pounds (I've been overweight since childhood, so I used to hate weighing myself the most. It wasn't until my senior year physical exam that I had to accept my weight. But at that time, I was just shocked, and I continued to eat and drink happily every day, happier than anyone else haha) Now I'm around 130 pounds, and it took me about a year and a half to lose the weight. Actually, the most important thing about losing weight is to control your diet. Eating less and being hungry will definitely make you slim!!! Occasionally exercising will make your posture look better, and it will also help us have smoother bowel movements. I have a few weight loss tips that can help us stick to it better:. 1‚É£Ô∏è Don't tell anyone about your weight loss plan. Telling others not only prevents you from losing weight but can also make you gain weight. 2‚É£Ô∏è Put on light makeup and wear pretty clothes every day. Just a little bit of self-care can really make you eat less and feel better. 3‚É£Ô∏è Don't pay too much attention to the number on the scale. I don't feel myself getting thinner, so I basically only weigh myself every two weeks, but! I often measure my body circumference. 4‚É£Ô∏è A very effective weight loss method: saving money. I set aside half of my monthly living expenses for future travel, so I only have half the money to spend on food, drinks, and clothes. Therefore, I spend less on food, eat less, and lose weight. 5‚É£Ô∏è Set a persona like a wealthy heiress. Which heiress needs to eat that much? 6‚É£Ô∏è Don't set too distant goals for yourself. For example, aim to lose 5 pounds this month. Although it's a small amount, achieving it will give you more motivation. Setting too high a goal can make you lose motivation and fail to lose weight, as haste makes waste. 7‚É£Ô∏è Instead of watching food shows, watch beautiful women. Watching food shows makes me crave and feel hungry, leading to a loss of control. But watching beautiful women gives me motivation to lose weight. I even set my favorite beauty as my phone wallpaper, which is very motivating. The above are just my little weight loss tips. These are all I can think of for now, and if I come up with more tips later, I'll let you know. Weight loss is a lifelong endeavor for women. Don't be anxious, don't rush, take it slow, and we will all be slim and beautiful.

Base makeup: Choose light, natural, and oil-control. Eyebrows: Thick and angular. Contouring: Highlight the contours for a stronger three-dimensional effect. 2. Men can skip lip color (apply lip balm before makeup to remove dead skin and add moisture). 3. If the lips lack color, use a nude lipstick and then blot with a tissue for a natural look. 4. After applying the base, you can choose setting spray or loose powder for setting. Hairstyle: Designed in a Korean-style for men. Fluffy textured hair.

First, I need to apologize to everyone here, school has started [DisappointedR] and there are too many things to handle, so updates have been a bit slow, please forgive me, dear readers [SmileR]. Back to the main subject, CLC450, what do you all think of this bike? Welcome to actively participate in my comment section and subscribe to my channel [FistBumpR]. First impression of the 450, seeing the actual bike did give me a bit of a shock, it has a British style appearance with a hint of American flavor in the foot position, and a crucial point is that the overall refinement of the bike is indeed superior to most domestic cruiser bikes in China. If you are a looks-conscious person and have a limited budget for a big import, this bike is definitely the first choice! First choice! First choice! (Important things to say three times). Talking about the two-day riding experience, I will compare it with my CM500 for easier understanding (once again, sorry for not taking any footage this trip [CryR]). First, both bikes are very similar in being lightweight and easy to handle, suitable for almost anyone. The highlight of the ride is that the exhaust sound of this bike is much nicer than the CM500, which deserves a praise [ThumbsUpR]. The biggest difference in riding, aside from the ease of handling, is the style of the bikes. Perhaps to cut costs, Chunfeng didn't equip this bike with a separate fuel injection system, but only tuned it based on the 450 sports bike, making it very sporty compared to the CM500, giving the feeling that the bike is teasing you. Another point worth praising is that this bike uses a belt drive, only those who have ridden it will understand, it's truly satisfying [HugR]. As for the configuration, Honda provides just enough, while Chunfeng is truly considerate, with a liquid crystal screen plus projection, plus TC and ABS, giving the impression that buying this bike is really worth it [CoverFaceR] (for old timers like me). Talking about the core question, can this bike really replace the CM500? My answer is: Yes! Unless you really like the very smooth and characterless handling of the CM500, I sincerely believe that in most cases, this 450 can definitely replace the CM500. In terms of riding feel, it has more character than the 500, and in terms of craftsmanship, it is also quite refined. In terms of post-ride modifications, both are cruisers and are similar. From the two-day test ride, this bike suits all age groups, young people ride it for its coolness, while older friends are young at heart. Regarding the reliability of this bike in the long term, don't worry, I have a friend who has already ordered it, and I will share his experience in more detail with everyone later [WinkR] #CanCLCReplaceCMAsideFromPrice[PK]# p. Welcome to discuss and exchange ideas (subscribe to my channel [CuteR]). If any friends have ridden this bike and find inaccuracies in what I said, please correct me, thank you all.",

On September 18, 2016, as a corporate slave, after being scolded by the client first thing in the morning, I don't know which nerve went wrong, suddenly wanting to rub something in my hand to calm down. So I started shopping on Taobao, originally just looking for some kind of stress-relief gadget. I looked at fidget spinners, squeeze bags, all sorts of quirky little gadgets, and eventually somehow stumbled upon walnuts. In my impression, these things were just for old men to rub, similar to health balls, not fitting the image of a tall, strong, and ambitious young person like me. If I took it out, wouldn't my friends and colleagues laugh at me? Not considering it. Continuing to look, after searching around and checking around, a decent fidget spinner costs three to four hundred yuan and is easily broken, squeeze bags are worrying for being toxic, so what should I rub? After turning around, I saw the walnuts again. Yeah, they are cheap, and mainly these things won't break, a few tens of yuan can last until I'm gone, it's settled, it's settled. Then I found the store selling walnuts that I first looked at. As a newbie, I didn't even have a concept of varieties, and I bought a pair blindly. It wasn't until today, when I decided to record my walnuts, that I looked through the purchase history and found that the picture shows Louzi, the title is Maohu, but what I received is Panlong Pattern [EmbarrassedR]. Base layer? Never heard of it. Brush? Too lazy to brush shoes, let alone this wooden lump? Why bother, just rub it as soon as it's back... \t.      My first pair of walnuts, 7 years old, played for less than a month in total, the idea of having them accompany me to the end was long forgotten, and I strayed further and further on the path of buying, buying, buying.",

        "content": "Today I recommend to everyone a lamp shop to avoid pitfalls. If you are choosing lamps on Taobao, see this shop/ run away!!! Block it. It really delays you for no reason/ either losing items or missing shipments. The story is in two parts‚òû. First part: magnetic track. Initially ordered the magnetic track/ pre-embedded during the hanging keel stage/ making a no-main-light setup. Waiting and waiting, then the item got lost/ small item, understandable. Ordered 50 cm separately/ cut into 20 cm sections. They told me their workers cut it very neatly/ okay. Sent over, not of the same length/ one 20.2, one 19.8/ it's really annoying. Then they resent/ installed, the long and short widths are different. They said the factory sent the wrong goods/ said they could resend to me. I really/ the ceiling work had to stop. The newly sent ones are still not the same width. But I compromised/ I can't afford to delay anymore, I can't wait. Then the customer service kept apologizing, saying they could apply a discount for future lamp purchases. I thought she also had a hard time/ who doesn't make mistakes. So there's the second stage: buying tube lights and light strips. I wanted smart ones/ initially they were very patient explaining to me. After I placed the order/ the troubles began. I asked how many days for the products to be sent together/ he said about 5 days. Ordered on the 23rd, shipped on the 30th/ arrived on May 2nd. On the 3rd, I found there were no light strips and transformers/ contacted customer service on the 4th. And they didn't inform me in advance about separate shipments. That is, if you don't ask, they won't check if it was really sent. She kept telling me she was asking the warehouse/ for 3 days. Then told me the warehouse missed the shipment/ me:??? Not a small item/ how can this be missed/ I'm really fed up. Kept saying sorry/ actually had a couldn't-care-less attitude. Then resent via SF Express/ and it was cash on delivery!!! Said they would reimburse, then said the warehouse forgot to send with payment. Anyway, all problems are pushed to the warehouse/ any issue is the warehouse's fault. Is this even a professional lamp shop for 13 years?/ OEM for a listed company?? Now they admit it's their shipping issue. But no direct response, no solution, no explanation. So friends buying lamps/ avoid this pitfall urgently.‚òû/ Zhenchuang Lighting Flagship Store/ really delays you for no reason. #Renovation Diary[Topic]# #Renovation Pitfalls[Topic]# #Lamp Recommendation[Topic]# #Lamp Not Recommended[Topic]# #Zhenchuang Lighting Flagship Store[Topic]##Online Lamp Shopping Pitfalls[Topic]# #Lamp Pitfalls[Topic]# #My Renovation Records[Topic]#..",

Scam [One R]: Demolishing walls and breaking walls for decoration destruction. The moment the worker arrives, he concludes that there's an issue with the wall. Watching the worker wield his tools, you say with concern: 'Thank you for your hard work, master!' But in reality, they may just be unable to accurately locate the leak point, so they demolish walls, and you not only have to pay for leak repairs but also for redecoration. Scam [Two R]: Low-price temptation with sweet talk $[Money Bag R] The quote is only a few hundred yuan, making your heart flutter. But in reality, halfway through the work, they will say that various places need repair and then raise the price on the spot, trapping you in a 'flow-style' passive price increase dilemma. Scam Three [Three R]: Material substitution with endless tricks They will say: 'These are the best materials, take a look for yourself.' But in reality, they may use inferior materials to deceive consumers with 'three-no products' (no brand, no quality certification, no manufacturer information). Scam [Four R]: Wasting people's money and effort, treating the symptoms but not the root [Weak R] You might think that since you've already redecorated, there shouldn't be any more issues. But in reality, if the source of the leak isn't found, it's only a temporary fix, and leaks will reappear soon. Scam Five: Verbal after-sales service, disappearing when trouble arises. [Secretly Observing R][Secretly Observing R][Secretly Observing R]. [Add One R] How to avoid these scams? [Magnifying Glass R][Magnifying Glass R][Magnifying Glass R]. When choosing waterproof repair services, always opt for big brands with unified charging standards, regularization, guaranteed and documented after-sales service, and a large number of verifiable construction cases.

The class of 22 has already been working for more than five months! Early preparation for next year's exams!

        "content": "Homeowner went crazy in the renovation group? How can renovation not drive people crazy? Today, Old Zhang went out to measure a house! Property staff: \"What do you do?\" Me: \"I'm the new security captain!\" Property staff: \"Gave me a cigarette warmly and invited me in!\" This shows that identities are self-imposed when outside! Back to the main topic. Project: 123 sqm large flat. Style: French retro. Quote: 80,000 yuan for semi-packaged. The homeowner shared some pictures with me and suddenly said in the construction group that he had gone crazy, which scared me a lot! I didn't expect it was out of happiness. Old Zhang, why can you persist in the renovation industry for so many years? It's because of the positive feedback from these lovely homeowners that makes me feel genuinely proud. That‚Äôs why people should engage in fulfilling endeavors! Because passion fosters perseverance! Because sincerity earns trust! Because quality guarantees security! Because service builds reputation! The aspect of this client that impressed me the most was that he had consulted many companies at the time, and although everyone's quotes were not very different, he had some doubts, so I explained to him later: The main unreasonable aspect of renovation companies lies in the model. The fundamental reason why some people's renovation results differ so much is due to the sub-contracting model. After the contract gets fragmented and subcontracted, the foreman can‚Äôt make a profit from the company and can only exert downward pressure, with additional items being one way to create profit ‚Äî fabricating non-existent elements for greedy gains. As a result, the final cost ends up having no limits depending on the foreman‚Äôs tendency to add items. Therefore, choosing a good model is crucial. You must find a non-subcontracting model. Selecting a non-subcontracting model is truly rare, as most are just marketing tactics. Why are foreman-directly-managed models so scarce? Because all workers being directly managed by a studio supervisor brings significant pressure, and relatively speaking, the profit is also less. Old Zhang has made it through this way; during the üò∑ period, I almost couldn‚Äôt hold on, but I have always persisted with the non-subcontracting model, insisting on improving construction quality and techniques. The advantage of directly managing workers is that I can ensure construction quality and avoid additional item problems! Because all prices are controlled by the studio, it prevents foremen from arbitrarily adding items. To put it bluntly, it‚Äôs like a blank market where supervision and guidance are present, and it will definitely be better than the chaotic subcontracting model where no supervision exists! Therefore, I suggest that when comparing construction studios, make sure to screen contractors based on craft, material, product, and experience, rather than focusing solely on price! Select those who can guarantee good results as your goal! If you can feel Old Zhang's sincerity and reliability, I hope you can give Old Zhang a chance. Old Zhang also hopes to meet someone as sincere as you! #MyRenovationDiary[Topic]# #ReliableContractorInChengdu[Topic]# #ReliableRenovationTeamInChengdu[Topic]# #ChengduRenovation[Topic]# #RenovationCases[Topic]# #RenovationDesign[Topic]#",

Comprehensively promoting rural revitalization is an important part of realizing agricultural and rural modernization. Under the overlapping background of ecological civilization construction and rural revitalization strategy, the value of lucid waters and lush mountains in rural areas becomes evident, providing new momentum for rural revitalization. China's rural areas are diverse in types with significant differences in development levels. Extracting typical models of rural revitalization in the context of lucid waters and lush mountains and analyzing their formation mechanisms is conducive to advancing rural revitalization in a tailored, situation-driven, scientific, and orderly manner. Research shows that lucid waters and lush mountains specifically refer to the natural-social-economic community with specific regional characteristics formed by the interaction and coupling of natural and human resources in rural areas. They are crucial resources for rural transformation, an important pathway for realizing value, and a significant carrier for comprehensive revitalization. The regional models of rural revitalization in the context of lucid waters and lush mountains present a 'spindle shape,' which can be divided into three major categories: urban-rural integration type, quality improvement and efficiency enhancement type, and relocation and consolidation type, as well as 11 subcategories including central town, community-oriented, park-oriented, material development, functional improvement, industry integration, ecological migration, relocation, and village merger. The construction of China's rural revitalization is systematic and complex. The establishment of a regional model database can provide models and pathways for regional rural revitalization. In the future, attention should be paid to the coordinated coupling of lucid waters and lush mountains with rural revitalization, striving to achieve a road to rural revitalization with Chinese characteristics where humans and nature coexist harmoniously.",

On June 26, 2023, the twelfth day of self-driving in the four Central Asian countries, the fourth day in Kazakhstan. Itinerary: Almaty (Almaty Lake National Park - Kyrgyz Consulate - Independence Monument - Panfilov-28 Warriors Memorial Park - Kok Tobe Mountain). At 14:30, after finishing lunch in a camping style, we wanted to learn about visa issues in Kyrgyzstan. Using navigation, we aimed for the Kyrgyz Consulate. When we were four kilometers away, the navigation instructed us not to go under the viaduct but turn right. However, we missed the turn and ended up lost. The navigation system became erratic. Finally, at a turn where our car was moving slowly, a police car behind us noticed our unusual driving behavior and gestured us to follow. The police guided us to a parking lot, asked for our license and passport, and inquired why we were driving so slowly. We explained that we were trying to find the Kyrgyz Consulate but got lost. The police checked our navigation app, pointed out we were going the wrong way, and offered to guide us. Following several turns, they eventually led us near the Kyrgyz Consulate. Before we could thank them, they drove away. Contrary to many negative reports in the media about Kazakh police, our experience was positive. We are very grateful for the help of these two Kazakh officers... After parking near the Kyrgyz Consulate, we entered to inquire about visa issues. The result was that visa processing would take a long time: five days for e-visas and ten days for consulate-stamped paper visas. So, we decided not to apply for a Kyrgyz visa at the Kazakhstan's Kyrgyz Consulate... At 16:00, we turned around to the Independence Monument to take photos... At 16:49, we left for the Panfilov-28 Warriors Memorial Park. This park is actually next to the Ascension Cathedral, which we hadn‚Äôt visited yesterday... At 18:10, we searched for food on a nearby street. Since we planned to watch the sunset at Kok Tobe Mountain, we bought some bread and buns to eat in the car. We drove to the parking lot halfway up the mountain and then took their shuttle to the summit. The summit was crowded, also accessible by cable car. We captured the sunset and a panoramic view of Almaty. Around 9:30 PM, after nightfall, we returned to the parking lot via shuttle and drove back to our accommodation.¬†¬†#CarSharing[Topic]#¬†¬†#MyDailyLife[Topic]#¬†¬†#SelfDrivingFourCentralAsianCountries[Topic]#¬†¬†#SelfDrivingTour[Topic]#¬†¬†#CrossCountrySelfDriving[Topic]#",

Dear friends, these tips are entirely based on my personal experience. Please view them kindly [FlyingKissR][FlyingKissR][FlyingKissR]. [ChecklistR] About joining tours. Don't be tempted by the low price of 1000 yuan per person, which includes helicopter rides or scuba diving, thinking it's a great deal. After all, considering accommodation, transportation, food, and tickets, no tour guide can lead a trip for free [CryLaughR][CryLaughR]. So, group tours are convenient (covering attractions, transportation, accommodation), but you should cooperate with the tour guide's work (either by shopping so the guide can earn a commission or putting up with a few complaints from the guide if you don't shop). Complaining less (since attractions are far apart) makes the journey happier [FlyingKissR]. [ChecklistR] About weather‚Äîit's mostly based on luck [CryLaughR]. Sanya is an island, and island weather is unpredictable, so try to avoid moderate to heavy rain [SweatingR]. Thunderstorms are okay (rainy days feel damp, and photos may not turn out well), but avoid extremely sunny days [SunR][SunR][SunR] (it's too hot, and direct UV exposure is no joke). Personally, I think temperatures below 30‚ÑÉ are best [MelonEatingR] (after all, too much walking in the heat is exhausting). [ChecklistR] About sun protection (a must-have, regardless of the weather). Essentials include sunscreen, sunblock spray, an umbrella, and sunglasses (preferably with UV protection). Non-essentials (nice to have, even better to use if not too hot) include sun-protective clothing, hats, and masks. [ChecklistR] Mosquito repellent (a must-have; I personally don't attract mosquitoes, meaning if others are traveling with me, mosquitoes mostly don't bite me or bite me less). Essential oils are lip balm-sized ointments or cream-like essential oils that can be used topically or placed in a room while sleeping. If allergic to essential oils, consider sprays like mosquito repellent liquid or floral water, which can be bought locally in small bottles sufficient for a few days. [ChecklistR] Swimwear and slippers‚Äîneedless to say, water activities are a must in Sanya. [ChecklistR] Light-colored clothes and skirts‚Äîany color looks good in photos, but I personally feel light colors are better. It's best to avoid overly flashy patterns. [ChecklistR] Waterproof phone case or airbag holder to prevent your phone from falling into the water while taking pictures. What else... I'll think it over and update later... #SanyaGuide[Topic]##SanyaTravel[Topic]##Sanya[Topic]##Travel[Topic]#",

Indeed, Hong Kong is a very suitable city for Citywalk [wowR], as taxis are expensive but the city is small. üö∂Walking + üöámetro is enough to get you to most places [thumbsupR]...\t...

Due to Hong Kong‚Äôs limited land area accommodating a large population, with a land area of only about 1,106 square kilometers and a population of approximately 7.5 million.

When Citywalking üö∂on the bustling streets of Hong Kong, one can observe that even in crowded conditions, the city remains orderly. Perhaps it is due to every citizen conscientiously adhering to these intangible rules of social etiquette üëç that Hong Kong has developed its current stable social system, solid as a rock üëè.\tAs new additions to this city, whether from the mainland or abroad, it‚Äôs also our responsibility to integrate into Hong Kong‚Äôs local culture and abide by social ethics proactively. ü§ùü§ù.\t#HongKong [hashtag] #HongKongIdentity [hashtag] #HongKongLife [hashtag] #HongKongTravel [hashtag] #Citywalk [hashtag] #HongKongCheckIn [hashtag] #HK [hashtag] #XiaoTimInHongKong [hashtag]#",

        "content": "Sometimes, avoidance is better. Some people say avoidance is shameful, but I would say that sometimes, avoidance is actually better.\t. Actually, I'm not saying avoidance is great, nor am I encouraging everyone to avoid challenges, but rather suggesting that when you're overwhelmed by emotions, you should first handle your emotions before tackling the problem.\t. We are often used to solving things first, believing that once the problem is resolved, our mood will recover.\t. However, in the face of surging emotions, our judgment and decision-making are inevitably affected. We may fail to see the essence of the problem and may also experience emotional exhaustion in the struggle against feelings, making the problem worse.\t. But when we try to solve problems while carrying strong emotions, it‚Äôs often hard to achieve good outcomes. After all, this is something we've likely experienced many times.\t. Only when our emotions are properly settled can we face the difficult things more calmly.\t. I can share a small tip: when you're emotionally volatile, find a corner to process your feelings and soothe yourself.\t. For example, spend an afternoon relaxing on the couch; take a day off and have a good sleep at home; go out for a workout and sweat it out.\t. We can escape to such corners to rest and care for our emotions, and only after that face each problem more calmly.\t. Everyone may go through particularly tough times‚Äîsometimes due to traumatic events in life, other times due to sudden relationship issues. During those difficult days, you'll realize that the most troubling things are often the emotions that arise because of the problems.\t. So instead of directly solving the problem, I suggest you properly address your emotions first and learn to treat yourself with a compassionate mindset.\t.

Start with the conclusion: „ÄêYou are not a legal expert, so you don't have to reflect on your own mistakes. Just focus on reinforcing your reasoning, making your logic airtight, and pointing out the other's mistakes„Äë.\t. Any dispute that leads to arguments necessarily has both sides at fault; it can't be one side overwhelmingly correct. Therefore, when we present our viewpoint, we are often met with reasonable counterarguments from the opposing side. Those who lack enough vigilance and determination might develop thoughts like 'What they said makes sense' or 'I might have done something wrong.' At this point, it's crucial to eliminate irrelevant information that works against you and emphasize viewpoints favorable to you.\t. Here's an example üå∞. During labor arbitration and mediation, our lawyer representing the worker demanded 500,000 yuan in economic compensation. The company proposed a 300,000 yuan compensation plan, but our lawyer refused. The company then started accusing our lawyer of deliberately obstructing the settlement and ignoring the worker's interests, thus delaying the worker's earnings. An unstable lawyer might fall into the trap of thinking, 'Could it be that insisting on the 500,000-yuan compensation is harming the client's interest by hindering the settlement process?' ‚ùå. A lawyer who has mastered the above method would refute on the spot, focusing only on the other's mistakes and reinforcing their own viewpoint ‚úÖ.\t. üëâ 'The company's illegal dismissal of the employee is the direct and sole cause of the employee's loss of benefits and is the reason we're all here discussing a settlement. The company's refusal to accept the 500,000-yuan compensation is the continued harm to the employee‚Äôs interests and shows a refusal to take responsibility, which should be corrected immediately and cannot be evaded' ‚úÖ. #LawyerLife[Topic]# #WorkplaceRoutine[Topic]# #CoupleArguments[Topic]# #MaritalArguments[Topic]# #CoupleInteractions[Topic]# #Debate[Topic]#",

Though after being squeezed by crowds all day, I temporarily don‚Äôt want to go back [LaughCryR]. Entered at 10 AM, chose to see the murals and Hejia Village treasure first since there were a lot of group tours heading for the basic exhibits. Photography wasn‚Äôt allowed in the mural exhibition. Don‚Äôt forget to return the shoe covers when leaving (or you‚Äôll realize after walking two kilometers [SweatR]). I had researched the origins of the murals and their owners' stories beforehand, so I only rented an audio guide and took my time admiring them. The large wall displays were truly breathtaking [WowR]. Spent a long time on the Hunting Scene, Polo Scene, Four Deities Diagram, and Court Ladies Diagram. However, at the ticket booth, the staff claimed there were no guides available‚Ä¶ even though both human and audio guides were options, which made people who entered without guides go back out after realizing others had them [DisappointedR]. The treasures from Hejia Village were exquisite, with dazzling gold and silver pieces [WowR]. By the afternoon, the basic exhibition halls were still flooded with group tours‚Ä¶ coupled with my dwindling energy, the exhibition experience significantly declined‚Ä¶ No crowd management, stuffy environments with chaotic tour groups following unauthorized guides, or columns of people blocking the showcases [LaughCryR]. Thankfully, I had watched Bilibili explanations in advance, but my plan to revisit specific artifacts and enhance my impressions was reduced to quick glances, corner breaks [DisappointedR]. Forget taking photos with fewer crowds, the backdrop for the Tiger Tally was just uncles' bellies, haha [LaughCryR]. Also, video guide sound mixed with onsite noise gave me a headache (or maybe it was the lack of oxygen), so I sped up my visit. Didn‚Äôt listen much to explanations about the Tang Dynasty section, just used personal historical knowledge to understand. Felt like many explanations were comparable to things you can find online, commercialized and formulaic. Encountering a guide adept at narrating origins and combining them with fascinating stories likely requires more than just current time and cost investment‚Äîluck and fate, too [LaughCryR]. Overall, the exhibits are top-notch, but management needs improvement. Personal feeling on cultural products is prices are high, so I mainly bought reasonably priced postcards. I‚Äôll organize them later; acrylic fridge magnets aren‚Äôt bad either. PS: The basement restaurant has decent cost performance with a variety of flavors [StarR].

Please like and follow first, I will update in time. Welcomeüëè everyone to discuss and add information actively~üôè. Let's talk about density first because it's more intuitive. Density refers to the compactness and texture, which novices care a lot about. Holding it in hand, the weighty feel and hardness can satisfy inner values. It's worth mentioning here that the density and weight must be considered in relation to the walnut's height, belly shape, and shell thickness. Please experience this carefully. Secondly, is the coloring always better with walnuts of higher density? I don't think so. At this point, many might disagree with me, which is why scientific walnut play and explanations are needed. Excessive density can stem from two reasons: 1Ô∏è‚É£ the walnut's inherent density, 2Ô∏è‚É£ late harvest time. Everyone knows that walnut polishing is achieved as the walnut kernel's oiliness interacts with the walnut's pore structures and through rubbing forms a patina over time. This is why rubbing a piece of wood won't give the same translucency as walnuts (oiliness works from the inside out). Overly dense walnut structures have excessively fine pores, slowing the breathing process and oxidation rate. Over the same accumulation period, due to hand sweat, the surface changes color at the same speed, but the patina develops more slowly than the coloration. The walnut's color darkens, but the patina isn't fully developed (the patina works similarly to a lacquer layer on wooden furniture, making walnuts glossy). Additionally, harvesting üå≤ too late causes walnut juices to over-stain its shell, making the base color too dark, and the patina is far slower than coloring. It's hard to achieve vivid colors. Think carefully, isn't the brownish color of a late-harvest walnut just the patina overlaid on its brown base? Therefore, the timing of harvest is crucial for good coloring. So in the future, don't simply think the same variety will always lead to the same color‚Äîit depends on harvest timing and origin (relying on experience, don't just listen to sellers' sweet talk). Soil quality and climate are like talents, unalterable factors. What we can do is judge by observing raw shell color and oiliness to make selections. Regarding color, it's more direct: pink, orange-red, and orange-yellow shells (without brown or dark tones) are easier to work into attractive results later. I think these are good base colors, leading to more beautiful results in the future. Oiliness is a particularly critical factor; it's the prerequisite for patina development. Experienced players can generally identify this easily. I'll explain this in more detail in future works. The determining factors for shell quality, besides variety and origin, include the mother tree and growth environment, as well as management methods. These are all key influences on walnut shell quality. Regarding specific shell color identification, I'll include pictures in upcoming works. I hope you'll like, save, and follow to enhance your knowledge and evaluation skills. Scientific walnut play is the essence; stories are always told by others, but knowledge is yours. üí™üí™‚Ä¶ Looking forward to the next issue üîî##Walnut [Topic]## #Playing With Walnuts [Topic]# #Premium Artistic Walnuts [Topic]# #Vintage Girl [Topic]## #Antique Walnuts [Topic]## #Beginner [Topic]# #Walnut [Topic]#",

I started with the J3 and switched to the J4, so let me summarize the advantages and disadvantages of these two generations of cleaning and mopping robots. 1. Cleaning ability: The Cloud Whale J4 has stronger cleaning ability than the J3 because its suction power is greater, up to 7800pa, and the cleaning mode is more intelligent. 2. Algorithm upgrade: The algorithm of the Cloud Whale J4 has been upgraded, making obstacle avoidance more sensitive. It can identify obstacles in advance and navigate around them. Additionally, it introduces an automatic dust collection function, reducing the need for manual operations and lowering the difficulty of operation. 3. Intelligent mode: Both products have the Whale Ling hosting mode, allowing for one-click hosting. They can both recognize the level of dirtiness on the ground and adjust the cleaning frequency accordingly, which is very smart. Of course, there are still some minor details that need improvement during use, such as the ability to cross thresholds is limited to only 2cm; it cannot cross high thresholds. Overall, I think the J4 is more advanced and user-friendly. For example, I bought the Cloud Whale J4 specifically for the no-hair-tangling function, which is the most advantageous feature of the J4. \t.#CloudWhale[Topic]##CloudWhaleJ3[Topic]##CloudWhaleJ4CloudWhaleJ4Lite[Topic]##CleaningAndMoppingRobot[Topic]#",

Today, I‚Äôll recommend eight more varieties. If they don‚Äôt look good, they won‚Äôt be recommended ~ No particular order. 1# Petra‚Äôs Wedding Viola [topic]# Pure white. There are not many varieties of Viola tricolor, although the flowers of this variety are relatively small, it‚Äôs still beautiful when it blooms profusely! #White Viola[topic]#. ‚ë°#Viola Daydream[topic]# #Daydream Viola[topic]# Gradually changing blue-purple-yellow colored Viola. The petals are very wrinkly and coiled, with a big name, but I feel its plant form is somewhat too compact. Individual flowers photograph well, but compared with other potted violas, it's less likely to grow profusely, and the plant shape is relatively small, which does affect its appearance! The color deepens when it‚Äôs cold and lightens when it‚Äôs warm. 3#Cherry Wreath[topic]# #Viola Cherry Wreath[topic]# #Purple Viola Big[topic]#. Flower, wrinkled petals, easy to explode with blooms, very large plant, very beautiful. 4#Lace Planet[topic]# #Viola Lace Planet[topic]# Found its color accidentally while buying flowers at a nursery. Fell in love at first sight, bought it, and then checked its variety name. Slightly smaller flowers, but the color is more visually appealing for longer~. 5.#Purple gradient with snowy borders[topic]# Super curled petals, which I really like!‚ë•ÔºÉSeeing Yuan Cloud, the color is so beautiful, I searched for the name myself, and it felt very similar. The color is very gentle, so I recommend you try it. When buying flowers from a nursery, it's cheap, what you see is what you get, and you might even find some rare flower colors!                             „ÄÇ#Black Coin[topic]# ÔºÉBlack Viola ÔºÉCoin Viola This one is a classic black Viola. Upon closer inspection, it‚Äôs actually deep purple with black undertones. I love its velvety texture. In the early stages of blooming, I pinched off many flower buds, and later it bloomed profusely. ‚ëß #Kochi Spring[topic]# #Viola Kochi Spring[topic]# The flowers are relatively small, but cutely small. The upper petals are light purple and the lower petals deep purple. Buying suggestions: The colors of Viola are truly diverse, and there are many purchasing channels: 1. Buy from large online stores. The earlier you buy, the more expensive it is because everyone is collecting them, and blooming periods are long. After the New Year, they are the cheapest because warm weather is coming, and people are clearing out stock! 2. Live sale broadcasts with one item per auction. Prices are higher, but the advantage is what you see is what you get, and you can choose colors. 3. Local flower markets and nurseries. These places will truly leave you dazzled with choices, and they‚Äôre very cheap!#Notebook Inspiration[topic]# #Want to Record[topic]# #Flower Knowledge Sharing[topic]# #My Flower Gardening Daily[topic]# #Viola[topic]# #Herbaceous Flower[topic]# #Viola Tricolor[topic]# #Viola Enthusiast[topic]# #Viola Tricolor Enthusiast[topic]# #Viola Planting[topic]# #Wrinkled Petal Viola[topic]# #Japanese Viola[topic]# #Flower Gardening[topic]# #Balcony Flower Gardening[topic]# #Balcony Garden[topic]# #My Flowers and Plants Growth Diary[topic]# #My Balcony Garden[topic]#",
