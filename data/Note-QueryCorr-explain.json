Try this method✅|[Red Book R] In recent years, there has been an increase in cases of Mycoplasma infection in women, primarily affecting the cervix, leading to cervical congestion and erosion, increased secretions, and urinary tract irritation symptoms. If not treated promptly, it can easily lead to pelvic infections. Many patients opt for traditional Chinese medicine due to the recurrence of Mycoplasma infection and the development of antibiotic resistance. Traditional Chinese medicine categorizes this condition under leukorrhea or stranguria. It is often caused by improper lifestyle, leading to damp-heat toxin infection, which damages the Ren and Dai meridians, resulting in increased leukorrhea, yellow or yellow-white in color, and damp-heat accumulation in the lower burner, causing frequent and burning urination.✅ The modified Wuwei Xiaodu Yin formula, with its heat-clearing and dampness-draining properties, has shown significant efficacy in treating this condition! [Seeding R] The basic formula includes Honeysuckle, Wild Chrysanthemum, Dandelion, Violet, White Birch Bark, Grassleaf Sweetflag, Phellodendron, Red Peony Root, Chinese Foxglove, and Angelica. [Right R] Honeysuckle, Violet, Dandelion, and Wild Chrysanthemum have heat-clearing and detoxifying effects, while White Birch Bark, Phellodendron, and Chinese Foxglove have heat-clearing, dampness-draining, and insecticidal effects. [Like R] A 5-year-old Ms. Liu suffering from Mycoplasma cervicitis sought TCM treatment after unsuccessful Western medicine therapy. [Like R] At the initial consultation, she had excessive yellow leukorrhea, frequent urination, and discomfort in the external genitalia. [Punch R] Her tongue was red with a yellow, greasy coating, and her pulse was slippery and rapid. TCM diagnosis: leukorrhea due to damp-heat toxin. [Red Book R] With the basic formula plus Gentiana scabra and Plantago asiatica, after one course of treatment, her leukorrhea reduced in quantity and became white, and she reported no discomfort after 30 days of continuous treatment. Monthly follow-ups showed negative Mycoplasma results for three consecutive months, indicating a cure.",

        "sentence2": "Do You Understand the Six Sex Hormones❓One Article to Clarify It All|I. Why Perform the Six Sex Hormones Test🧐By analyzing hormone levels through testing, determine if there is an endocrine hormone imbalance, thereby identifying the presence of metabolic diseases and finding the reasons affecting pregnancy! For example: it can diagnose the development and maturity of follicles, determine if there is polycystic ovary syndrome, ovarian function decline, hyperprolactinemia, etc. II. Precautions for Testing 1. Testing Time: On the 2nd-5th day of menstruation: At this time, hormones in the body are in a basal state, with higher accuracy, reflecting the state of the ovaries! Especially for those who want to understand ovarian reserve function, basic ovarian function, polycystic ovaries, premature ovarian failure, etc., be sure to check during this time! Ovulation period check: This period is the peak value of the ratio of luteinizing hormone to follicle-stimulating hormone, which can clearly indicate the development of the ovaries, mainly looking at luteinizing hormone, progesterone, and estradiol. Luteal phase check: One week before menstruation, at this time progesterone is at its peak during the luteal phase, patients with recurrent miscarriage can be checked during this period to see if there is a low progesterone situation. III. Analysis of Each Value Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH value): Normal level: 5-10 IU/L It is a glycoprotein hormone secreted by the adenohypophysis, whose main function is to promote the development and maturation of ovarian follicles, and is a good indicator for assessing ovarian function. Luteinizing Hormone (LH value): Normal level: 5-10 IU/L Its main role is to promote ovulation and can act in conjunction with FSH. Under the synergistic effect of both, the corpus luteum is formed and progesterone is secreted [secretly observing R] 1. Ovarian failure Basic FSH>40 IU/L may indicate weakened ovarian function (note that if it occurs before the age of 40, it is called premature ovarian failure.) Both basic FSH and LH <5 IU/L suggest hypopituitarism or pituitary dysfunction, and the distinction between the two requires the aid of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone test. 2. Poor ovarian reserve function Basic FSH/LH>2~3.6 indicates a decline in ovarian reserve function, with FSH within the normal range. It is an early manifestation of poor ovarian function. Basic FSH>12 IU/L: consecutive twice indicates a decline in ovarian reserve function, and the specific judgment of ovarian reserve function also needs to be combined with the total number of antral follicles and indicators. Prolactin (PRL) Normal level: 3.34-25 ng/ml Estradiol (E2) Normal level: 73.4-146.8 pmol/L (20-40 pg/ml) Mainly secreted by the ovaries and a small amount by the adrenal glands, its main function is to promote the growth of the endometrium to the proliferative phase! Testosterone (T) Normal level 0.15-0.4 ng/ml High testosterone can also cause infertility Patients with polycystic ovary syndrome will also have elevated blood T levels, accompanied by symptoms such as hirsutism, acne, hair loss, amenorrhea, etc. High testosterone in the blood or hyperandrogenism is an important indicator for diagnosing polycystic ovary syndrome.

If acute B lymphoblastic leukemia cannot achieve complete remission after 1~2 courses of chemotherapy (primary drug resistance), or if it recurs during chemotherapy, or if it recurs after stopping medication and chemotherapy is ineffective (drug-resistant recurrence), the best method is to undergo CAR-T therapy. For some high-risk acute B lymphoblastic leukemia, the cure rate with chemotherapy or other treatments alone is very low, and due to reasons such as old age, poor organ function, and no suitable donors, they cannot undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, so CAR-T therapy can also be added to the original treatment to prevent recurrence. In our country, chronic B lymphocytic leukemia patients are rare (even more rare in children), and chronic B lymphocytic leukemia generally develops slowly with many treatment options. For older patients, the treatment focuses on extending life and improving quality of life, and aggressive treatment is not necessary, so CART therapy is rarely used in our country for treating chronic B lymphocytic leukemia.",

Munchkin Cat Munchkin Cats have short and sturdy limbs, making them particularly cute, and they have a good temperament, being a non-aggressive breed loved by many. However, they are relatively expensive and not very suitable for office workers to raise. No matter what breed of cat you raise, during the process, you must pay attention to the cat's diet, especially the protein content in cat food must be high, as too low will definitely lead to malnutrition in cats. It is best to choose a cat food with a protein content of 37%~48%, such as “Charm Pet Chicken Cat Food” with a single chicken meat source, low sensitivity, and easy digestion, with a protein content between 40%~48%, fully meeting the daily nutritional needs of cats. 3. American Shorthair Cat If you like lively and clingy cats, the American Shorthair Cat is suitable for you. They are not only cute but also very friendly to people and easy to get along with, being a non-aggressive breed. Even if you have another cat at home, it won't mind. 4. Sphynx Cat The Sphynx Cat is also a non-aggressive cat, though it looks a bit fierce on the outside, but its heart is very kind, very friendly to people, and will not attack humans. However, raising a Sphynx Cat involves many considerations and is expensive. What other cats do you think are non-aggressive? Follow me, and you won't get lost in cat raising.",

Today, I'll share my 'journey', to ease your minds, my dear babies ❤️~ Remember to 👀 favorite 👀 and follow~ ✅ First, you need to confirm if you are experiencing bleeding during ovulation. I still recommend everyone to get a hospital diagnosis. My symptoms are like this: My menstrual cycle is 28 days (very regular), and my period lasts about 7 days. Generally, around the 7th day after my period completely ends, I have a small amount of bleeding again. The amount is very little, basically not even needing a panty liner. Sometimes it's red, but most of the time it's dark brown, lasting 4-5 days until it stops. During ovulation, I experience abdominal pain, similar to menstrual cramps, lasting several hours to a day. The amount of bleeding is related to my mood, stress, or exercise that month. ✅ What tests are needed for bleeding during ovulation? 1. Cervical cancer screening 2. Gynecological internal exam 3. Gynecological ultrasound 4. Hormonal tests Before having my child, all these tests were fine, so the doctor confirmed it was bleeding during ovulation. ✅ Does ovulation affect conception? If it's just bleeding during ovulation, there are no organ issues, it's just that during the fertile ovulation period, intercourse is not possible. But since I didn't bleed every month, I could try to conceive in the months without bleeding. ✅ How to alleviate bleeding during ovulation? 😜 First, go see a doctor with a good mood, reduce your psychological stress, this is super important. I was quite relaxed, and got pregnant successfully the second month~ ❗️ These situations require treatment: Prolonged bleeding, longer than 7 days Heavy bleeding Very short intervals between menstrual periods Bleeding during ovulation every month I've had symptoms of bleeding during ovulation since I was 24, but it didn't affect my ability to have a child at 27, so don't worry, my little fairies.

        "sentence1": "Is Qiaohu worth subscribing to?",
        "sentence2": "I want to have a serious talk about 'Qiaohu' | I started subscribing to Qiaohu when Kuankuan was 7 months old, and yesterday we received the toys and picture books for 18 months (Kuankuan is 17 months old, we received it one month in advance). I won't say much about the ones before 12 months, as neither the toys nor the picture books had any outstanding points for our family~ From 13 months onwards, we receive 1 toy, 1 bedtime story book, 1 cognitive book, and 1 good habit toy book every issue. Below are my thoughts on the pros and cons: 🌞Pros: 1. The picture books have no odor, the toys have no burrs, and the quality of Qiaohu is excellent. 2. There is a correlation between the picture books and toys, such as the 17-month-old toothbrushing theme. In addition to the toothbrushing toy and the good habit book: 'Brush Little Teeth', in the bedtime story book, Dr. Hippo treats a toothache for a little crocodile, and the diagnosis is to have the little crocodile brush his teeth well. 3. The bedtime story book is my favorite, with simple stories, bright and clear illustrations, and a flip-page design. Babies of a young age can't handle complex storybooks, but Qiaohu's storybooks are just right. 4. The cognitive book is Kuankuan's favorite, and it is indeed well-designed. The front has real-life pictures, and the back is in cartoon form, making it easier to understand and simultaneously exercising the baby's ability to recognize real and unreal items. 🌛Cons: 1. Lag: Most babies nowadays are very smart. For example, the 18-month-old fishing toy, Kuankuan could play well with similar toys at 13 months. Now receiving it at 18 months, it's not very useful for the child. 2. substitutability: For example, the 17-month-old cognitive book about various faces, we had already bought a similar emotional cognition book at 13 months, so we only flipped through this one once and didn't touch it again. 3. Toys: Most of Qiaohu's toys are relatively simple with single functions, and the likelihood of keeping a child focused for a long time is small. At least that's the case in our family; the child prefers Montessori toys that require hands-on and thinking. Qiaohu's toys are more about the novelty, and they get abandoned after a short play. Summary: From my personal perspective, I won't renew the subscription because we already have many similar picture books at home, such as the later issues on colors and shapes, which the child has already mastered. However, for busy parents who don't have much energy, it is recommended. Regarding habit formation, the Qiaohu sleep aid at 14 months did give our family great help, and now every night's independent sleep requires it. But I think it's not just relying on a certain toy or picture book that forms good habits in babies; it requires continuous input and attention from parents~",

Early pregnancy items and costs: [Grass Planting R] Blood test to confirm pregnancy + B-ultrasound appointment → Actual payment 216.5 yuan. Notes: [One R] The first hospital visit was after using a home pregnancy test that showed two lines, then going to the hospital for a blood test confirmation. The gynecology department is right after the escalator on the 3rd floor, then report to the nurse's station. [Two R] Payment → After the doctor issues the order, pay first before going for the blood test. [Three R] No need to fast for the blood test, the location is at the obstetrics department on the 3rd floor. [Grass Planting R] Transvaginal ultrasound to confirm if the fetus is viable in the uterus + blood test → Actual payment 41.9 yuan. Notes: [One R] I did the transvaginal ultrasound around 6 weeks +, it provides a clearer view. If doing a B-ultrasound, you need to hold urine by drinking more water. [Two R] I also had an additional blood test to see if the values had increased. If the values were already good during the first test, one test might be enough, depending on the week of pregnancy. For those who can be patient, you can also delay the test. [Grass Planting R] Designated hospital + NT scan appointment → Actual payment 18.5 yuan. Notes: [One R] Due to an extra blood test, I didn't designate the hospital during the previous visit, so I had to come again. [Two R] With the pregnancy certificate, you can go to the 1st floor to designate the hospital. After designation, the NT scan is not self-paid. (Refer to the previous Little Red Book for designation strategy). [Three R] We also got free prenatal check coupons from the community hospital, but they were not usable because the Maternal and Child Hospital fully reimburses NT and major anomaly scans.

Notes: [One R] NT scan is a type of B-ultrasound, which can be reported on the phone (when near the hospital). [Two R] NT results are available quickly, and the doctor will prescribe further tests based on your NT results. My results were normal, so I was prescribed a blood test for early Down syndrome screening. [Grass Planting R] File creation + various checks + major anomaly scan appointment → Actual payment 201.7 yuan. Notes: [One R] Fast on the day of file creation because the doctor will prescribe a lot of tests, like blood and urine tests. [Two R] If you haven't designated the hospital yet, don't delay, do it before payment to avoid a prenatal check fee of 1500+.

Occasionally, there is mild itching. Filiform Warts: The skin lesions are skin-colored or gray-brown, slender, soft, and pedunculated growths, ranging in number from a few to several hundred, resembling small nails standing on the skin surface, commonly found on the eyelids and neck. Common Warts: Soybean-sized, brown or skin-colored papule-like lesions, rough surface, hyperkeratosis, hard, and papillary. Plantar Warts: Initially small, shiny papules, gradually enlarging, with keratinized, rough, and uneven surface, colors ranging from gray-brown, gray-yellow, or dirty gray, with clear boundaries, surrounded by a slightly raised and thickened keratin ring. Regardless of the type of wart, it should be taken seriously. Pay attention to the cleanliness and hygiene of the wart.

        "sentence1": "Can amblyopia be cured",
        "sentence2": "What kind of older amblyopia has greater treatment value? | As is known to all, there is an age window period for amblyopia treatment. The earlier visual intervention is carried out, the better the treatment effect. Does it mean that amblyopia cannot be cured in older age or adulthood? First of all, it is certain that the latest research results conclude that visual plasticity is lifelong, which means that even at the age of 40 or 50, amblyopia patients can still achieve visual improvement through visual awakening. However, as age increases, this visual plasticity efficiency becomes slower and slower. Traditional ophthalmology believes that the best period for amblyopia treatment is generally between 3 to 5 years old, the effect significantly decreases after 7 years old, and there is basically no hope of cure after 12 years old. To describe it in terms of treatment efficiency, for the same type and degree of amblyopia, starting treatment at the age of 4 can lead to clinical cure in half a year; starting treatment at the age of 40 may require 5, 6, or even 10 years to achieve clinical cure. In addition, for some older and adult amblyopia patients, even with full effort, the treatment value is very small. Therefore, facing older or adult amblyopia patients, the viewpoint of Ming is: 1. If there is treatment value, it is necessary to go all out to strive for it, even if it is a bit difficult and slow; 2. Even if the vision does not reach the standard level, some improvement in vision can also visibly improve the quality of life; 3. Furthermore, for severe monocular amblyopia patients, if the corrected vision of the poor eye is too low, in case the good eye suffers visual impairment, it will lead to difficulties in self-care. If the poor eye gains some improvement through treatment, the reserve eye becomes extremely valuable in the event of such a disastrous outcome. With the advancement of technical conditions, if a child is screened for amblyopia, parents must not have a fluke mentality and should act early to avoid future troubles.

        "sentence2": "Damai·Concert｜Personal successful ticket-snatching tips|🔹Background First of all, let me talk about my recent concert ticket-snatching achievements🏆☑️May 9th Friday 2023 Beijing Bird's Nest Concert First pre-sale snatched 4 tickets for June 3rd Saturday (Row of 4 seats)🎫¥555*4 Ticket Snatching App: Damai☑️May 12th Fish Leong 2023 Shanghai Concert snatched a leftover ticket for May 21st after the first pre-sale ended🎫¥999*1 Ticket Snatching Mini Program: Ticket Star☑️May 16th Fish Leong 2023 Shanghai Concert Second pre-sale snatched May 21st🎫¥999*1🔹Ticket Snatching Tips 1. Based on the ticket snatching situation for the recent two concerts at the Mercedes-Benz Arena (Milk Tea🥤 and Fish Sis🐟), a lot of tickets are usually released on Damai the day before the concert. For Fish Leong's concert, lots of tickets were released around 16:00 on Friday, May 19th, lasting nearly 10 minutes. Apart from the ¥499 level tickets, tickets in all price categories and even consecutive seats🎫 were easily available.⚠️Key Point: It is recommended to join official fan groups as they will notify you quickly when Damai releases tickets. Set group message notifications🔔 to get alerts immediately and act fast; your success rate exceeds 90%. The precondition is that you've pre-saved attendee ID information in the app, increasing efficiency significantly. 2. When using Damai to snatch tickets, use your own 5G data connection rather than WiFi. Download a tool - Floating Clock. Search🔍 the app name: ZK Assistant. Its countdown can be precise to milliseconds (a smaller time unit than seconds). Before snatching, close all background apps except Damai and ZK Assistant. Keep the interface minimal to fully mobilize phone resources for optimal performance to respond to the ticket-snatching process.📱Ensure the best response speed⚠️Key Point: If you get kicked out during payment, don't give up. Within the first 5 minutes, there's a chance to snatch returned tickets; make sure to seize this opportunity. After the first 5 minutes, there will still be chances to grab returned tickets at 10 minutes, 15 minutes, etc. Keep refreshing ticket options—fortune might smile on you, allowing you to get a ticket. The key is not to give up the special opportunity within the first 5 minutes. 3. Avoid resorting to scalpers unless absolutely necessary. This year is a big year for concerts; original ticket prices have already increased, and scalper markups are even crazier. Plus, since most artists are touring extensively, if you can't buy local tickets, you could head to nearby areas for a cheaper option. From my experience with Fish Leong's Shanghai concert second pre-sale, it's easier than the first pre-sale. Ticket placement times during the two pre-sales indicate a significant difference.🆘Attention: For the May 5th Beijing Bird's Nest Concert, I secured four consecutive seats in just 14 seconds during the first pre-sale. For Fish Leong's Shanghai second pre-sale, I got one ticket🎫 at 52 seconds—it shows how much easier it became for the second pre-sale. May everyone reading this set of tips succeed in grabbing tickets for their desired concerts this year～Wishing us all good luck! ㊗️",

        "sentence2": "If you are taking postgraduate entrance exams in late July/August (politics, mathematics, professional courses) | Continuation from the previous part, politics section ➕ mathematics section ➕ professional course section: ✅ 2. Politics Politics is considered one of the easiest subjects to score high marks with relatively less time investment. Philosophy principles may require attending a lecture, especially for those with zero political foundation; follow Teacher Xu Tao's intensive course. For Mao Zedong Thought, historical outline, moral education, and legal foundation, it is recommended to use Teacher Xiao Xiurong's '1000 Questions' to memorize the key points faster. Start in September: First go through one section of the detailed explanation, then complete the corresponding questions in '1000 Questions.' It takes about one and a half months to finish the first round of '1000 Questions.' For the second round, you don't need to consult the book; just use '1000 Questions' directly for review (the questions in '1000 Questions' are not particularly difficult, mainly serving as a tool for knowledge recall). While doing the exercises, use blank sheets of paper to write down answers instead of writing directly on the book; this facilitates second and third-round exercises. A special note: Mark the wrong answers, and during the third round, focus only on revising incorrectly answered and critical sections. After three rounds of '1000 Questions,' it will almost be mid-November. Then, attempt writing the multiple-choice part of past exam papers, followed by reviewing key points for essay-type questions with Teacher Xu Tao to alleviate the pressure of memorizing Xiao Four (Xiao Xiurong's four sets of mock exams) later. Exam questions for politics are closely related to current affairs, so don't rigidly memorize the answers; some content requires flexibility on your part. As for current affairs, there's no need to accumulate extra material by yourself. Simply practice the questions in the mock tests given by various teachers, as memorizing excessive content can cause more psychological pressure. Regarding mock tests, Xiao Eight (Xiao Xiurong's eight sets of mock exams) and Xiao Four are a must-have set for every candidate, especially Xiao Four. Start memorizing essay questions as soon as you get the sets; don't hesitate (it's recommended to memorize them one set at a time, with importance decreasing the further they are in sequence). You can also buy test sets from Teacher Xu Tao or 'Leg Sister' for practice; just do the multiple-choice questions to consolidate the key points (politics might contain a few less common questions, but the majority are quite routine). ✅ 3. Mathematics (see image p4 above) ✅ 4. Professional Courses Professional courses are non-public subjects, so they cannot be studied in a completely standardized way, but using them as a reference is still doable. Initially, you can allocate about three hours a day for preparation (more time should be devoted to mathematics and English). Later, you can adjust the duration based on your progress. The most important thing is to clearly understand the scope and quantity of the content being tested in your professional course and then break it down further. This means setting a small goal for yourself each day. Once the overall plan is well-structured, just follow through step by step. Memorize what needs to be memorized, build frameworks where necessary, and summarize key points as required.",

However, very few people know the difference between the two. So, what is the difference between 925 silver and 999 silver? Which one is better, 925 silver or 999 silver? Follow me to take a look! ① The difference between 925 silver and 999 silver① The main difference between 925 pure silver and 999 pure silver lies in the silver content. In fact, 925 pure silver is not pure silver, only 999 pure silver is true pure silver. ② 925 is not pure silver. Its silver content is 92.5%. According to international standards, 925 silver differs in processing technology from pure silver. Thus, its brightness and luster are very similar to platinum, and its hardness is better. Therefore, 925 silver is widely used in jewelry production. 925 represents the silver purity, which makes it a lower-grade type of silver jewelry. ② Which is better, 925 silver or 999 silver?① Many people ask which is better, 925 or 999. Actually, 999 pure silver is better because of its higher purity, which reaches 99.9%. The 925 type tends to oxidize and turn black over time, so it must be worn with care. Secondly, there’s the 990 purity, also called sterling silver, with a silver content of 90%. ② Due to the high silver content of 999 and 990, they are softer and more suitable for making plain silver jewelry. These are also among the types we commonly encounter. Even the internationally recognized minimum standard for pure silver is called 925, or international standard silver. ③ 925 silver jewelry usually has 7.5% copper alloy added during processing, which increases its hardness. It's very suitable for making floral-style jewelry. Finished silver jewelry usually goes through electroplating for polishing, so it has better oxidation resistance compared to 999 and 990. However, silver jewelry must still be maintained to keep it looking fresh and exquisite. It is important not to wear it carelessly for long periods, as that can lead to the jewelry losing its luster. ④ This is the end of the sharing. Remember to like, thank you!",

        "sentence2": "C-section is actually not that scary! 2️⃣| Continuing from my previous prenatal experience, I'd like to share my C-section process! When admitted to the hospital, I initially wanted to request a single room, but the nurse said there were no single or double rooms available, so I had to be placed in a regular ward. *Later, I discovered that some rooms were actually empty, and I wondered if those rooms were reserved only for Malays or government personnel. The nurse told me my surgery was scheduled for 8 a.m. the next day. Perhaps due to excessive anxiety, I had a very light sleep that night, and coupled with the heat, I got up at 4 a.m. to wash up. 1. Catheter insertion - Pain index ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ After freshening up, the nurse dressed me in surgical clothing and arranged for the catheter to be inserted. It was very painful and felt gross. You constantly feel like you need to urinate but can't. However, before you know it, your urine bag slowly fills up. 2. IV drip - Pain index ⭐️ It doesn't really hurt, but there’s a feeling of soreness. Afterward, I was just waiting for the doctor to schedule my surgery. Unexpectedly, around 7 a.m., a nurse came and told me that another woman had an emergency and needed urgent surgery, so she was prioritized. As a result, my surgery was delayed until 10 a.m. After a long wait, when they finally prepared me to enter the operating room, it was already past 11 a.m. Once everything was ready, the nurse pushed me from my ward to the operating room. Those few short minutes felt extremely long, and I was so scared. On the way, I looked at my husband, and tears uncontrollably streamed down my face. 3. Anesthesia - Pain index ⭐️ On the operating table, the doctor asked me to sit and hug a big pillow, curling up like a 🦐. Then they started administering anesthesia. Honestly, the anesthesia injection didn't hurt, but you could distinctly feel the anesthetic spreading in your lower back, until the lower half of your body went numb. 4. Incision/Stapling - Pain index ❌ No pain at all, but you can feel them working on your belly. After about 30 minutes, I heard our baby's cry. The entire surgery took roughly two hours, and then I was wheeled out. Seeing my husband, who had waited for two hours, outside the operating room gave me an inexplicable sense of peace. The whole procedure was done while I was fully conscious, but probably because I was extremely hungry and cold, my upper body trembled violently (I asked the nurse during the procedure, and she said it's normal). For four hours post-surgery, I couldn't drink or eat anything. Possibly due to the side effects of the anesthesia, I began to feel nauseous and vomited, which was particularly uncomfortable. The next day, my body started itching all over, and I suspected it might have been caused by the anesthesia, but the itching gradually subsided after 2-3 days. When I fully regained consciousness, my baby was already by my side. It's been a week since the surgery; I have slight backaches and bruising around the incision, which makes it hard to get up or lie down. Other than that, most of the recovery has been good. But when you see your baby, you'll feel that everything was worth it all. 🤍🤍",

Many people buy an apartment as a transitional home. So, what are the benefits of apartments? 1. No purchase and loan restrictions. Due to policy factors, the current residential purchase restrictions are strict, excluding individuals without the qualification to buy a home. Moreover, groups with housing needs and investment demands, when unable to choose residences, can only consider apartments as a transitional choice. 2. The building area of apartment buildings is generally small, mostly ranging from 30-50 square meters (although there are some over 100 square meters) in the market. The unit price is lower compared to residential properties, so the total price is generally not high, with a low threshold for purchase. 3. Diverse purposes. Since the land nature of apartment buildings is for commercial use, apartments can be used both for living and for registering a company. This aspect makes apartments more versatile compared to residences. 4. More complete facilities. Apartments are usually located near subway or rail transit lines, with at least one large-scale commercial building nearby.

For example, for patients with vascular diseases, soaking feet in hot water is of no benefit to people with varicose veins and venous thrombosis and often leads to worsening or aggravation of the condition, even disasters. If you have conditions such as lower limb arteriosclerosis obliterans or diabetic foot, high-temperature foot soaking may cause amputation! Knowing these principles, it is recommended that everyone confirm whether they have vascular diseases before soaking feet, and only proceed if there are no such concerns. 02 Why is soaking feet at 9:00 pm the best? As the saying goes, 'all diseases come from cold, cold starts from the feet,' the simplest way to expel dampness and cold is to soak your feet. The soles of the feet are enriched with various human acupuncture points; soaking your feet daily can expel the dampness and cold accumulated in your body, promote blood circulation, and expel toxins, which are greatly beneficial to the body. The reason for choosing this time for kidney nourishment is that it is when the kidney meridian's qi and blood are relatively weak. Soaking the feet during this time increases body heat, dilates blood vessels, and promotes blood circulation, allowing the body to achieve better regulation. Additionally, the nervous system after a day's tension and the kidneys after a day's fatigue can fully relax and recover through foot soaking at this time, making one feel comfortable. 03 Five taboos for safe foot soaking 1. Women should not randomly use traditional Chinese medicine for soaking feet during menstruation. 2. Avoid soaking your feet within an hour after eating, as it may affect digestion and absorption over time, leading to nutritional deficiencies. 3. Use a wooden basin for soaking feet with traditional Chinese medicine. 4. Children should not soak their feet in excessively hot water for long periods, as doing so may lead to flat feet. 04 Adding extras to foot soaking water can expel cold, warm the lungs, and improve sleep. Feet are the part of the body farthest from the heart, with the longest distance for blood circulation and significantly affected by gravity, making blood return particularly difficult. Moreover, the feet gather all the body's meridians, and if the feet are cold, the whole body will feel cold, reducing the body's resistance and leaving room for diseases. Hot water causes blood vessels to dilate and speeds up blood circulation. Soaking your feet moderately every day is akin to installing a 'pump' at the lower body, which not only assists the heart, accelerates blood flow, and boosts immunity but also improves the skin on the feet and relieves and eliminates fatigue. There's a saying: 'The rich take tonics, the poor soak their feet.' Adding different ingredients to the hot water produces various benefits: Adding wormwood: expels cold dampness, warms the uterus, harmonizes blood and qi, eliminates foot odor. Adding ginger: dispels cold, warms the body, promotes sweating, and removes odors. Adding motherwort: reduces false fire, clears heat, eliminates stagnation, expels stasis, and chills. Adding safflower: breaks blood stasis, improves circulation, relieves fatigue, and relieves pain. Adding salt: relieves fatigue, treats constipation, aids sleep, and treats colds. Adding Sichuan pepper: supports yang energy, moves qi, removes odors, and expels dampness. Adding vinegar: promotes blood circulation, treats athlete's foot, removes foot odor, and expels wind and dampness. Warm reminder: While soaking feet has many benefits, it should not be overdone; it should be tailored to one's constitution.
