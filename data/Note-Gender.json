With her excellent professional ability, Xiao Gui becomes the most noticeable focus of the event. Their paths cross again as the CEO, a VIP guest, also notices Xiao Gui on stage. Feeling the world is too small, he picks up the headpiece and makes a frivolous gesture towards Xiao Gui.

This way, not only will the other person find you more understanding, but you will also feel more relaxed yourself. Remember: treat the other person the same way they treat you, if they prioritize themselves and their career, you should also prioritize yourself and your career. If you foolishly put him first, the relationship will definitely be imbalanced.

This question popped into my mind during a casual chat with my mother-in-law. In her view, without children, a marriage is hard to sustain. 'Without kids to raise, what can a couple do together for so long? It's too boring.' This is understandable and widely accepted. After all, in the past, marriages were largely about having children. Traditional family roles dictate men work outside and women inside. Men and women have significant differences in traits and abilities, even in battlefields, but in child-rearing, they share joys and sorrows equally, and the sense of responsibility is mutual. Therefore, children are both the purpose of marriage and its bond. Without children, the family falls apart. But this isn't the whole truth. If it were, how do we explain couples who are stable and fulfilled without children, or how do we explain our joyful six years together before pregnancy? \n\nRecently, the more I think about having a child, the more I realize that childbirth and parenting might be the biggest challenge to our marriage. We used to be like trees growing side by side, or kids playing in the mud. In our relationship, sharing outweighed caring. We went through everything together, which kept our spiritual growth in sync, and more importantly, we shared joys and sorrows. \n\nHowever, since planning for a child, this balance has been disturbed. My anxieties are beyond his comprehension, and his hardships are not fully felt by me. Like trees growing in opposite directions, the pain without personal experience is abstract. \n\nMoreover, I have reason to believe that the real challenge begins after the child's birth. For instance, as new parents, potential conflicts arise: \n‚Ä¢ Different family roles lead to disconnected emotions. I'm tirelessly caring for the baby, hoping for a break when you get home, but you feel exhausted and just want to rest.\n‚Ä¢ All attention shifts to the baby, neglecting the partner or seeing them as an emotionless tool.\n‚Ä¢ Disagreements over childcare details between in-laws, each sticking to their own views. Mismanagement of any of these can escalate conflicts, each with significant impact. \n\nWhether to have children or not, each stage of a marriage faces its own tests and traps. There's no one-time solution. For those who marry for offspring, children are the purpose of marriage; without them, the marriage seems void. For those who value love and partnership, children can make one vulnerable and divert attention. Most people, like me, are somewhere in between, facing dual challenges. What to do? Just face them head-on. \n\nMost importantly, recognize the pitfalls. I'm preparing myself not to be tripped up. \n#Marriage[Topic]# #Parenting[Topic]# #PregnancyDaily[Topic]#\nasr:\nocr:, An interview from years ago, translating for him, raising a cat, strolling through city streets, a nice day camping by the lake, 07, 30+ first pregnancy, what I discovered after becoming pregnant (Part II), exclusive French interview Œæ, IDEAS, running renovations with masks on New Year's Day 2020, exploring mountains and lakes together, cooking seriously, skiing together",

Recently, a female patient, 36 years old, visited the clinic. She has been widowed for several years and has not remarried, thus having no sexual activity during this period. She heard that this might cause her menstrual flow to decrease and lead to premature ovarian failure. She was quite worried. In fact, there is no direct relationship between sexual activity and premature ovarian failure. First, we need to understand that premature ovarian failure refers to the decline in ovarian function before the age of 40. It is not directly related to sexual activity. She has always had a stable menstrual cycle, and her concerns are largely unnecessary. It's important to maintain a positive mindset and regular health check-ups.

After a girl was raped by someone, she willingly had sex six more times and then accused him of rape. How should the court handle this? Don't worry, let me explain slowly. The rogue Zhang San and the beautiful internet broadcaster Xiao Fang met online and chatted for a few months. On March 28, 2023, they agreed to meet offline. After meeting, Zhang San took Xiao Fang to a hotel and forcibly had an indescribable affair with her. After that, Xiao Fang originally wanted to report to the police, but Zhang San told her to continue dating and confessed his love to her on the spot. So the naive Xiao Fang agreed to continue the relationship. Within three months, Zhang San and Xiao Fang had sex six more times until July 20, 2023, when Xiao Fang became pregnant and was discovered by her parents, who immediately reported to the police, demanding that the public security organs hold Zhang San criminally responsible. The police arrested Zhang San and brought him back to the case. The question arises: can the fact that Xiao Fang willingly had sex six times afterwards negate the first rape? Does Zhang San still constitute the crime of rape? Zhang San believes that he and Xiao Fang have been in a romantic relationship since childhood and he never forced her; they always had consensual sex, so it does not constitute a crime. Xiao Fang, however, believes that she was violently sexually assaulted the first time and had no ability to resist, so she was raped.

According to the platform's rules, Liu Mingsheng could only qualify to meet the anchor by becoming the 'Top Donor'. With a monthly salary of just 6000 yuan and the expenses of a family of four not being a small sum, as a senior accountant in the company, he had control over a large amount of funds flowing in and out of the subsidiary. He took advantage of his position to secretly transfer public funds from the company's account to reward the anchor. After becoming the 'Top Donor' in K Bao's live room, Liu Mingsheng immediately flew thousands of miles to the northeast to meet his 'dream goddess' whom he had longed for day and night. Liu Mingsheng fulfilled his wish to become K Bao's offline lover and engaged in sexual relations. In early 2022, during the group company's reconciliation, a large sum of funds was found to be missing from the accounts managed by Liu Mingsheng. Ultimately, Liu Mingsheng decided to face his mistakes bravely and surrendered to the public security authorities accompanied by his colleagues. According to the investigation by the public security authorities, Liu Mingsheng had embezzled about 123 million yuan from the company's account, rewarding the female anchor K Bao with 90 million yuan, and other two anchors with 6 million yuan and 4 million to 5 million yuan respectively, with the rest of the money being squandered. Through the joint efforts of the judicial authorities, most of the embezzled funds of about 123 million yuan were recovered, totaling 122.68 million yuan, and the company's operations were not significantly affected.

The Weaver Girl was originally a fairy, but after losing her powers, she couldn't carry things on her shoulders or lift things with her hands, and she was beaten and scolded by the Cowherd every day. Then the Weaver Girl started weaving, but the cloth she wove was too good for ordinary people to enjoy. Those who wore the cloth woven by the Weaver Girl had problems in their homes. Later, the old yellow cow in the Cowherd's house became too old to work. The old yellow cow told the Weaver Girl that since she was old anyway and could speak human language, eating her meat would grant longevity. The Cowherd planned to kill the old yellow cow and sell her meat for money. To save her life, the old yellow cow told the Weaver Girl where her wings were hidden. It turned out that the Cowherd had hidden her wings in the ancestral tomb to prevent her from flying to heaven. The Weaver Girl found her wings and told the Cowherd that eating the old yellow cow's meat could grant immortality. Then she put on her wings and flew to heaven. The Cowherd thought that since the Weaver Girl was a fairy and he was her husband, they should go to heaven together to enjoy happiness. So he killed the old yellow cow, ate her meat, sat on her skin, and carried two baskets on his shoulders with their children inside, flying towards heaven.

The man points seriously to a table behind him, asking the girl to help him get something and hand it to him, and apologizes politely, saying that it's closing time and asking if there's anything else he can help with. Unexpectedly, the man grabs the woman's hand and tries to pull it towards his body. Just at that moment, the boss's voice is heard, and the man quickly withdraws his hand.

After returning to Melbourne, I joined Herm√®s. Initially, I was moved by the brand's craftsmanship spirit, and I personally love Herm√®s products, which are exquisite like artworks in every aspect. However, after becoming Sister Gui, I realized that what sales and customers see are different. Today, I'm contributing my professional value and sharing some efficient tips for getting bags at Herm√®süëÇ\nüî∏ Show enough respect to the SA and the brand, communicate frequently, no more than 2 months apart, and have a continuous consumption record, at least once per quarter.\nüî∏ SA recommends cost-effective products for allocation: men's wear, women's wear, and jewelry. These allow the SA to earn commissions quickly and demonstrate the customer's strong purchasing power. Home products are not recommended due to long reservation and production cycles.\nüî∏ The shortcut for allocation is men's wear! Because it's hard for SA to meet sales targets for men's wear... Those who know, know.\nüî∏ Personally, I suggest not buying single items for allocation. Continuous cumulative consumption better reflects brand loyalty. In case rules or the SA change while waiting for a bag, you can still accumulate under the new SA. Don't over-allocate at once.\nüî∏ If the SA suddenly leaves, it's advisable to clarify personal needs with the new SA under the guidance and introduction of the former SA. If you get along well, buy something small on the same day to foster a good relationship and show importance.\nüî∏ Know your own strength and act accordingly. There's no need to put too much pressure on yourself for luxury bags. All roads lead to Rome. For those who are slightly under economic pressure or have enough but don't want to deal with the counter, SuperA might also be a good choice. Many wealthy people I know mix real and fake bags, but please always avoid obvious fakes‚ùóÔ∏è\n‚ñ™Ô∏è\nI had a familiar client who found a good one @Gao Pengüêé. Master Gao has been making bags at Herm√®s' European factory for over twenty years and has trained many apprentices. Now he's back in China doing his own thing‚ùóÔ∏è The craftsmanship and technology are identical to üêéüè† factory, using original hardware and leather. The leather feels right, and the hardware, edges, and engraving are all perfect, even with the unique light fragrance of Herm√®s leather, making it the pinnacle of Herm√®s replicas! Even insiders can't tell the difference!\nRaising üêé essentially means joining the brand's game. Only by understanding the rules can you pass quickly. That's all for today.

I hope this sharing can give everyone some inspiration and help. \n#JobSearch[Topic]# #EF[Topic]# #English[Topic]# #EnglishWorld[Topic]# #SayItLoud[Topic]# #LearnEnglish[Topic]# #EFEnglish[Topic]# #AdultEnglish[Topic]#\nasr: Many friends have been asking me how to speak fluent English abroad, many need English for their careers, and quite a few are preparing to study abroad. I myself started relearning English at the age of 34, driven by the idea of studying abroad, and also hoping to have more choices in my career in the future. On the road to learning, I've stepped into many pitfalls, but thankfully, I've persisted until I realized my dream of going to the United States at the age of 38. Now my fluency allows me to chat with friends from different countries and accents on any topic. English has not only opened the door to the world for me but also helped me seize many valuable opportunities in my subsequent studies and work, achieving accomplishments I never dared to dream of before. Therefore, today I want to share my experience of practicing speaking English. Based on my experience, adult English learning should focus on several aspects. First is time management. With work and various family chores, English learning must be fragmented. I suggest not being overly ambitious about studying for three or four hours a day, as this can turn your English learning into a burden, making it difficult to sustain. Second, the purpose of learning English should be clear. If it's for career English interviews or business negotiations, the content needed is completely different from travel English. Preparing for language exams for studying abroad is also different, so a clear purpose can avoid detours. The third point, which I want to emphasize the most, is to use current high-tech tools or AI to make English learning more efficient. Just like how we now use QR codes to pay instead of going to the bank, sending emails instead of mailing paper letters, the time and energy saved\nocr:, until 38 years old to realize studying in the United States, talking with friends of different accents on any topic, learning English with friends at the same level, relearning English at 34, studying in the United States at 38, speaking fluent English without going abroad, method sharing, courses for adults over 18 long-term effective, 3. Using high-tech tools, the third point is also what I want to emphasize the most, listening to some English podcasts on the way to and from work, achieving accomplishments I never dared to dream of before, starting with EF's online group courses, learning, Learn, AI adaptive intelligent learning system and teachers, LESSON 4, 24-hour online, how to share, ‚Ä¢Philosophy learning system 24-hour online, interest, ¬∑More than 2,000 hours of interactive learning content, ¬∑Diversified learning tools, INTEREST, ‚Ä¢ASR advanced speech recognition system, AI adaptive intelligent learning system, intelligent recommendation of learning content, ‚Ä¢Small class Œæ teaching Face 1o Face, ‚Ä¢Online private conversation class Private Lesson, Hyper Class, EF, it achieves 24-hour uninterrupted classes, I wbl 'Œæ, Ny duam t, not only learned useful expressions for this topic, BANK OFAM RICA, BANK OFŒæMERICA, BANKOF, also helped me in my subsequent studies and work, 3.

Dogs howl and bark non-stop as soon as they get into a cage, it's too cruel. Anyway, keeping a dog in a cage makes it unhappy, it's animal abuse.\n       First, let's clarify a concept, caging doesn't mean keeping the dog locked up in a cage for a long time. What a cage is, depends entirely on your definition.\n        If the cage is a place for punishment, scolding, or even isolating the dog, then your dog will feel anxious as soon as it enters the cage.\n        If the cage is a place for eating, resting, or even where you reward it, then your dog will feel happy in the cage.\n          You must have encountered this, when your dog feels scared or nervous, it will hide under the table or bed. Why? Because such a relatively enclosed space makes dogs feel secure.\n         So a comfortable cage plus the right guidance and training methods will make your dog feel safe and settled inside.\n        Caging can also effectively prevent your dog from developing separation anxiety. Once the dog recognizes the cage as its safe haven, no matter how the outside environment changes, as long as its little world is still there, it will rest and sleep peacefully inside.\n      Do you think letting your dog roam freely in a large room when you're out gives it freedom?

However, I have a lot of luggage, and I haven't found a place to settle in the new location yet. It's also inconvenient to carry all my belongings with me. Therefore, I decided to rent a small storage warehouse in Chengdu to store my luggage.\n.\nThis warehouse, named Wanwu Storage, is referred to as a small warehouse, but its overall scale is not small. Initially, I wanted to find a mini warehouse for storage, but the price was too high. Moreover, I found that when there are many items, the space above in the warehouse cannot be fully utilized. Many things cannot be stacked too high, and the space is somewhat wasted, as the rental is for the entire space. Therefore, choosing Wanwu Storage, which calculates the cost based on the actual volume occupied by the items, seemed more reasonable to me, as there would be no wasted space.\n.\nThe overall environment is also well-ventilated and moisture-proof. Instead of just leaving items on the ground, they are first packed and then placed on shelves, avoiding scattered placement everywhere. The key point is that regardless of how long you store, a formal storage contract is signed, providing assurance for your storage.\n.\nFor your reference, one cubic meter can accommodate about five to six 24-inch suitcases, making it quite cost-effective. This information is for those who have storage needs. Wanwu Storage has warehouses both within and outside the Chengdu city area, and they also offer door-to-door pickup services, making their overall service very convenient.\n#Moving[Topic]# #Chengdu[Topic]# #ChengduMoving[Topic]# #LocalMoving[Topic]# #InterprovincialMoving[Topic]# #EverythingCanBeStored[Topic]# #Storage[Topic]# #MiniWarehouse[Topic]# #LuggageStorage[Topic]# #WhereToStoreLuggage[Topic]# #Storage[Topic]# #Warehouse[Topic]# #TemporaryLuggageStorage[Topic]#\nasr:\nocr:, LVGAFABFSPX320006, ŒæMODULE",

This is a topic of great interest to many expectant parents. Today, I will share some knowledge about this with you, hoping it will be helpful.\nFirstly, we all know that genes are one of the important factors determining individual hereditary traits. As the biological father, the father naturally has an impact on the child's genes. So, specifically, what genes do fathers inherit to their children?\n[1R] Skin Color Gene: Skin color is determined by multiple genes, including those related to melanin production. If the father has a darker skin color, the child may also inherit a similar skin color.\n[2R] Eye Color Gene: Eye color is also determined by multiple genes. If both the father and mother have light-colored eyes like blue or green, the child may inherit light-colored eyes.\n[3R] Hair Quality Gene: Hair quality and type are also influenced by genetics. If the father has characteristics like curly or straight hair, the child may inherit similar hair quality.\n[4R] Height Gene: Height is determined by multiple genes. If the father is tall, the child may inherit a relatively taller stature.\nOf course, these are just some examples. In reality, there are many other genes that fathers pass on to their children. It is also important to note that inheritance is not completely deterministic and is influenced by other environmental factors and gene interactions.\nUnderstanding these knowledge points in the parenting process can help us better understand our children's characteristics and needs, and provide targeted education and care. It also allows us to cherish every moment spent with our children.\nI hope today's sharing has inspired and helped you. If you have any other questions about parenting or want to learn more related knowledge, feel free to leave a message and exchange ideas! üí¨\n#Parenting Experience[Topic]# #Parental Inheritance[Topic]# #Parenting Knowledge[Topic]# #Scientific Parenting[Topic]# #Scientific Parenting Tips[Topic]# \nasr:\nocr:, Fathers inherit to children, four major genes, let me get up?, 4.Laziness, If the father does not keep hygiene, not keeping the house clean and tidy, the baby sees very clearly, soon, will learn, Fathers inherit to children, four major genes, 3.Baldness, The father's baldness is also inherited, but most are, inherited to boys, Fathers inherit to children, four major genes, 1.Body Type, The father's body type has a 90% chance of being inherited by the child, if, the father is fat, the baby has a high chance of being fat in the future, those, expecting a girl should pay attention, especially the father must, lose weight to a normal body, Fathers inherit to children, four major genes, having a boy or a girl, depends on the father, generally the father will inherit to, the baby these four genes, sisters, must remember to forward, let your partner take a good look, Fathers inherit to children, four major genes, 2.Eyes, The baby has a 70% chance of inheriting the father's eyes if, the father has double eyelids, then the baby is lucky",

However, love-struck Pi Yu was indifferent to the overwhelming criticism she faced when appearing with him.\nocr: Not only did she continue to publicly flaunt her love, but the latest related information also revealed that she ignored internal criticism, prohibited others from disclosing her true character, and mishandled newfound fame. Suddenly over a short period, a wave of negative revelations emerged online. Nonetheless, good times didn‚Äôt last long.

Netizens teased, 'Aren‚Äôt you her aunt?' 21 minutes ago, a user replied, 'Oh, author Mommy. My ex-husband never allowed me to appear on camera, haha. I could only accompany PY for simple photography. Auntie‚Äôs restriction, but now I‚Äôm liberated. I can appear with my daughter. It‚Äôs joyful.' From Pi Yu-chan, two minutes ago, another user responded, 'Little Station.' DQIVAD-YEN had been engaged in importing precision instruments from Israel for 20 years. Skeptical replies, 'So fake.

She wakes up every morning with messy hair that even Jiao Ba can't stand. When she goes out, she's like this. I've never seen her put on makeup at home. She doesn't bother with dressing up either. In the morning, she first gives dog food to her dog, eats a simple breakfast, changes into comfortable clothes, and then goes out to have fun with her friends. As she leaves, she says, 'Mom, I'm not coming back for dinner tonight.' All of this resembles exactly what I say to my mom when I go out to hang out. After meeting up with Pei Jiang (a friend), the two also had very realistic conversations about their parents urging them to marry. 'I always feel like not having children is just fine,' Jiao says. 'Then as we get older, a few of us good friends can live together in a nursing home or something. Although not having children means loneliness for some, it seems like something everyone does, so you must do it too.' This mindset probably resonates with many young women nowadays.

At first glance, Aunt seemed cold, but from her standpoint, this was a character-consistent decision.\nAunt was merely Grandma Jiang's daughter-in-law's younger sister and had no familial feelings toward Grandma Jiang. Over the years, she had watched her own sister being mistreated in this household with helplessness. She resented the elderly woman for her favoritism toward males and indulgence toward her own son.\n\t\nAunt resented the elderly woman for spoiling her son, which had led to her sister's current predicament. In her sister's moment of despair and helplessness, with no one in the household to take charge, Aunt had no choice but to step in.\n\t\nMrs. Jiang did not oppose this arrangement. On one hand, she lacked the power to object, having spent half her life playing cards and not even knowing how to cook. On the other hand, she also resented the old woman for years of neglect and disregard toward her and her granddaughter. She wanted to escape this household and even felt a sense of relief and satisfaction with her sister's arrangement.\nJiang Nansun was a direct victim of the preference for boys over girls, so she should have been even more supportive of Aunt's decision in principle. However, as Jiang's granddaughter, she had a natural bond with her father. Moreover, she was kind-hearted. Grandma Jiang was her biological grandmother. No matter how unfair Grandma Jiang had been to her, she still couldn't bear the thought of sending her elderly grandmother to a nursing home in her old age.\n\t\nRight now, the only person available to care for the elderly woman was Jiang Nansun herself, so she thought about it for a whole day before making her decision.\nGrandma Jiang was not an ordinary old woman. When she heard about the arrangement to send her to a nursing home, she remained composed, displaying the demeanor of an aristocrat in decline. What‚Äôs more, having spent her life avoiding chores, she lacked the confidence to live alone. Her prideful exterior masked her inner fears. So later, when Jiang Nansun volunteered to take care of her, she broke into tears, as if given a new lease on life.\nThis fearful experience of facing a nursing home acted as both a punishment for Grandma Jiang's past behavior and a psychological reconciliation with her granddaughter, paving the way for a closer bond in the future. #MagnifyingGlassChasingDrama [hashtag]#\n#MyBestFriendGoldenYearsZhuSuosuoYeJinyan [hashtag]# #MyBestFriendGoldenYears [hashtag]#\n#Entertainment [hashtag]# #Actor [hashtag]# #YuanQuan [hashtag]#\nasr:\nocr:",

Show this to your husband quickly; doing less housework will make your wife more beautiful. This has a professional term in science called 'tired face,' which occurs when excessive workload, mental pressure, and over-fatigue lead to insufficient sleep. This will manifest in the face. First, insufficient blood supply to the face leads to poor complexion. Second, the blood circulation around the eyes compensates, causing dark circles and upper eyelid swelling. Third, changes in the muscular contractility can cause upper eyelid drooping and alterations in the corner of the mouth, making the whole person's mental state appear less energetic. Fourth, decreased skin hydration can lead to dry skin, more fine lines, and wrinkles, including forehead wrinkles and nasolabial folds. These problems not only result in tired-looking faces but, if persistent, can make people appear older in the long run. To avoid these problems, it is crucial to regulate your emotions and practice emotional management. This way, you can avoid significant mental stress and anxiety at work. As the saying goes, 'wearing oneself out' is not unfounded. The body and mind affect each other.

Origami combines abstract and tangible qualities, has both two-dimensional and three-dimensional aspects, and requires both hands-on actions and mental thinking. These characteristics perfectly align with the requirements of art education in kindergartens. Therefore, I designed this activity. Although the children's first attempts at folding weren't particularly aesthetically pleasing, it didn't diminish their sense of achievement. Instead, it sparked their interest in continuing to fold paper.

Can the company really revoke my household registration?\"\nFresh graduates can indeed have their household registration revoked!\nImpact of resignation for fresh graduates\nIf a fresh graduate resigns immediately after completing household registration, the company will be blacklisted for household registration applications and will not be able to apply for Shanghai household registration for others in the future.\n[LeaningAgainstWallR][LeaningAgainstWallR][LeaningAgainstWallR] Under what circumstances can household registration be revoked?\n1. The fresh graduate did not fulfill the labor contract. The cost-effectiveness of fresh graduate household registration is very high, and scoring or direct household registration is very fast. It requires fresh graduates to stay in the unit for at least 1 year. If less than 1 year, the unit has the right to revoke the household registration;\n2. There were illegal behaviors during the household registration process;\nAside from fresh graduates, other types of household registration methods, such as student returnee registration, talent introduction, and residence-to-household registration, cannot be revoked; once household registration is completed, which means after obtaining the ID card, there's no need to worry about the cancellation of the household registration.\nThis is because the company does not have the authority to revoke the household registration that was already settled. However, the company can apply to the public security department to cancel your household registration qualification. The specific decision lies with the public security management office, not the company; as long as your household registration is legal and there‚Äôs no violation, it will generally not be revoked.\nHowever, before obtaining an ID card and downloading approval or publicity, since household registration is applied for through the company's account, it is very likely that the company will cancel the household registration application.\n[PityR][PityR][PityR]\nHow to avoid having your household registration application canceled by the company?\nDiscuss and negotiate with the company in advance. If the company cooperates and you have not committed any violations, the household registration process can proceed smoothly.\nPS: Although changing jobs is a normal thing, if it affects the company, the company is likely to choose to revoke the household registration. Therefore, it‚Äôs still recommended that you complete the required time or negotiate with the company before resigning.\n#Shanghai International Student Household Registration[Topic]# #Shanghai Household Registration[Topic]# #Shanghai Household[Topic]# #Household Registration in Shanghai[Topic]# #Fresh Graduate[Topic]# #Household Registration[Topic]#\nasr:\nocr:, Application for Shanghai Permanent Residence for Returned Overseas Students, Application Form, Name, Gender Female, Nationality Han, Date of Birth January 13, 1996, CN, Address, Peop, Citizen Identity Number, 31524, Shanghai Municipal Human Resources and Social Security Bureau",

Received a particularly fake 50 Euro bill\nCategory: Life records - cross-cultural life\nBody: This fake 50 (above) was pointed out to me by the cashier when I went shopping. After recalling, it might have been during a lunch break when a girl bought just a 3.5 Euro mochi, couldn't find small change, and pulled out a ‚Ç¨50 folded into a small square from her wallet. Since there was a queue behind her, I didn't pay much attention, just opened it, put it into the cash register, and gave her the change right away.\n\t\nLooking at it now, I can't help but laugh at my own foolishness‚Äîit looks like Monopoly money, and the anti-counterfeit features are cartoonish. I've learned my lesson now: I need to use a pen to mark it, feel it, and check carefully. I've heard that the most common fake notes in circulation right now are ‚Ç¨20 and ‚Ç¨5. If I have to check every ‚Ç¨5, I'll be testing bills constantly.\n\t\nEveryone, remember to double-check any change you receive.

I think it's so funny and interesting. Take a look at this. This mom said that sometimes when her kid is being noisy while riding in the car, she gives the kid a choice: either do five mental math problems or stay quiet. The kid immediately quiets down. The parent asks, 'Is this approach right?' Hey, parents, what do you think? I think there is an issue here. On the surface, in the short term, you did make the child quiet, but you've planted a seed in their heart. A five-year-old instinctively thinks math is disgusting and horrible. Just doing math problems makes them frustrated. They‚Äôd rather say fewer words than do math. You are constantly reinforcing this negative impression. If you start hating math so much at age five, how can I even believe in the possibility of them learning math well? Instead of fostering interest, you're fostering dislike. How does this common sense escape you? There are so many ways to help a kid calm down. Even scolding them would be better. Although they'd forget a physical punishment after a while, instilling a hatred for math is something they'll remember for life. I just don't see how your kid will grow to love math in the future, or how you'll cultivate their interest in math once you realize the problem. Parents casually say, 'Oh, I wasn‚Äôt good at math back then. Am I stupid? Maybe my kid inherited this from me.' If you keep saying things like that, your child will adopt the belief, 'We‚Äôre just not good at math. I don‚Äôt like math either.' If your child ends up excelling in math, I‚Äôd truly be amazed. Honestly, even prayers won‚Äôt help you. Language is a weapon; language is powerfully destructive. I hope all parents can understand this.\nocr:, How do you make your kids, hate math, How do you make your kids, hate math, How do you make your kids, hate math, How do you make your kids, hate math, How do you make your kids, hate math, How do you make your kids, hate math, There‚Äôs something not quite right, How do you make your kids, hate math, How do you make your kids, hate math, How do you make your kids, hate math, How do you make your kids, hate math, How do you make your kids, hate math, Resist and detest, How do you make your kids, hate math, How do you make your kids, hate math, Keep it in mind quietly, How do you make your kids, hate math, A face of disbelief, Like Share Favorite, How do you make your kids, hate math, How do you make your kids, hate math, How do you make your kids, hate math, How do you make your kids, hate math, How do you make your kids, hate math, How do you make your kids, hate math, How do you make your kids, hate math, How do you make your kids, hate math, How do you make your kids, hate math, How do you make your kids, hate math, How do you make your kids, hate math, How do you make your kids, hate math, So hard to deal with, Sigh, How do you make your kids, hate math",

I've noticed that there are many people who love Korean-style outfits. Today, let's continue discussing practical and approachable outfit ideas from Korean female celebrities. By leveraging the charm of the drama 'Little Women,' Kim Go-eun has recently caught some attention with her appearance, featuring essential simple series items that she wore for events.\nocr: , ELLE, Her relaxed and moderate style is indispensable. Low-saturation simple items have helped her a lot. She looks like a delightful, well-bred heiress. These are styles we can replicate with items we already have: simple but not clich√©, relaxed yet elegant. Her refined and comfortable style often involves outfits like cropped jackets and tailored pants for a touch of sophistication. Crisp lines and subtle color highlights can make a big difference too. She's also good at playing with intricate details on large blocks of color. Kim Go-eun's appearance is fresh and clean, her kind of elegance is unmatched; she avoids looking overly dramatic. Replacing an oversized sweater with a proper shirt or trying a tight top-loose bottom pairing to elongate the waistline works wonders. This is Serena's Fashion, and see you next time.",
