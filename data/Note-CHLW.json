By the Tang Dynasty, water wheels were used to lift water to the roof to simulate rain, called the self-rain pavilion. There was also the practice of storing ice blocks from winter in underground cellars for summer use, but all these methods had limitations. It wasn't until 1902 that Willis Carrier utilized the principle of water mist evaporation for cooling and successfully invented the world's first air conditioner, ushering in a new era. Modern air conditioners work by pumping liquid Freon through pipes; when it passes through nozzles within the pipes, it turns into a gas, lowering the pipe temperature, which is the indoor unit. To enable circulation, gaseous Freon is sent back to the compressor via pipes for compression, then cooled by fans to revert to liquid form, which is the outdoor unit. Finally, it is transferred back to the nozzles to complete the cycle. Thanks to Willis Carrier, the coolest man of summer, and generations of ancestors who strove for coolness, countless efforts have finally led to a cool summer\n\nPossible highlight word options list:\n['Willis Carrier', 'seven-wheeled fan', 'Freon', 'self-rain pavilion']\n\nPlease provide a list of words you think are suitable for highlighting.

Only factories truly running their own operations understand this. For distributors, it's just payment and shipment without intermediate steps. When consumers shop, there could be a mountain of issues and doubts, and ultimately, they might not even place an order. It requires immense patience and integrity. Factories can take this on, but it shouldn't be their primary focus, and they must not compete with distributors for terminal resources. Harmony brings wealth. Building a reputation takes years or even decades, but ruining it only needs one or two incidents, collapsing in minutes. Factory self-management is not easy. Proceed with care and cherish the opportunity. For consumers, being able to come across this by chance is pure luck. It indeed saves a lot of money. Consumers should try to see the actual product before placing an order to avoid being deceived. Just some friendly advice, that's all.
