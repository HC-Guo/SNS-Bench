        "content": "Query: \nYellow Tower Peak Hiking Route\nLevel:\nCheck-in Spot\n\nDoc:\n<Doc>\nThere are three ways to walk to the Shiliang Waterfall, which one is more energy-saving?\nThere are three ways to walk to the Shiliang Waterfall. See Figure 3, purple is the 1st route, blue is the 2nd, and yellow is the 3rd.\n\nFirst method, conventional [SmileR]\nFrom the visitor center all the way to the bottom of the Shiliang Waterfall, it takes an hour, and it's all cobblestone paths, not easy to walk. Although there are some small views, it can only slightly alleviate boredom. After reaching the bottom of the Shiliang Waterfall, going up to the Guangfang Temple is a continuous climb of steps, very tiring. Then, to the exit, you still need to walk more than 600 meters. After reaching the exit, you need to take the scenic area's vehicle back to the visitor center parking lot. Personally, I think this design is extremely foolish, not only tiring for the legs but also extremely wasteful of time. Of course, if you just want to walk through the valley and roam for half a day, it's suitable.\n\nSecond method, enter from the old entrance (use Gaode navigation, locate: Southeast Parking Lot of Tiantai Mountain Shiliang Scenic Area, Figure 8) [SmileR].\nSoon after the entrance, you can see the Middle Guangfang Temple, which is above the Shiliang Waterfall. The Middle Guangfang Temple is currently under maintenance and cannot be entered. From the temple, you can circle down beside the Shiliang. A continuous flight of steps leads down to the Old Guangfang Temple, and a few more steps down is the classic panoramic spot of the Shiliang Waterfall. Then, walk all the way back to the visitor center. From the Small Copper Kettle Waterfall, it's also a continuous climb of steps, shorter than the first method from the bottom of the waterfall, but it also has a vertical elevation of 50-70 meters, which is also tiring for the legs.\nBefore reaching the visitor center (right beside the steps to the visitor center), there is a small path that crosses a small hill back to the old entrance parking lot, taking about 10~15 minutes. This section also involves climbing and requires someone in good physical condition. Driving from the old entrance parking lot to the visitor center parking lot takes less than 10 minutes. See Figures 9~12 for details.\nThis method is often mentioned on Little Sweet Potato as a labor-saving strategy. But it didn't really save much effort. If you definitely want to walk the entire route, the second method is more suitable than the first. At the same time, a companion needs to be willing to climb an extra 10 minutes of mountain road to drive.\n\nThird method, follow the second method all the way down to the bottom of the Shiliang Waterfall. Then return the same way. [SmileR]\nAlthough you have to walk a long section of steps, it involves walking an extra 2-3 kilometers of mountain road, and climbing a section of steps to exit, I think this method might be more friendly to the legs. And it's also suitable for people who are short on time. To see what the Small Copper Kettle Waterfall and the First Seal of the World look like, see Figures 6-7. Judge for yourself if it's worth walking those 2~3 kilometers of mountain road. ¬†#Tiantai Mountain Shiliang Waterfall[Topic]# ¬†#Shiliang Waterfall Strategy[Topic]# ¬†#Tiantai Strategy[Topic]#¬†¬†#Taizhou Strategy[Topic]#¬†¬†#Travel Strategy[Topic]#\n</Doc>\n",

It contains a variety of plant essence extracts that can anti-wrinkle and tighten, making sagging face and fine lines non-existent.\n-\n3‚É£Balanced Diet\nEat well at every meal, do not diet, the appearance of dieting thin is different from exercise thin,\nProtein, carbohydrates, and dietary fiber should all be supplemented, especially more protein, lack of protein will make the face sag!\n-\n4‚É£Exercise Back Daily\nExercising the back can treat sagging face, which everyone should know. I prefer to exercise at home without equipment, standing cow face hands, bending over A-shaped stretch, each action lasts for 30s. Also, do not overdo aerobic exercise, as excessive aerobic exercise can lead to sagging face.\n-\n5‚É£Do Not Stay Up Late\nStaying up late will make the face sag. Sleep well, and the face will rejuvenate. Early sleep can actually be beautifying, a full sleep makes the face naturally fuller, be sure not to sleep on the side, as side sleeping can press out nasolabial folds.\n-\n6‚É£Maintain a Good Mood\nYour own emotions can also affect your appearance, stay away from everything that consumes you, no internal friction, good mentality, love to smile~ the corners of the mouth and eyes will turn upwards, be sure to love yourself well.\n-\nüíïStart doing these anti-sagging face methods today, everyone can have a tight, bright, plump, and uplifted face and a healthy body!!!\n#Mask[Topic]##Mask Recommendation[Topic]##Tightening Mask[Topic]##Anti-Aging Mask[Topic]##Skincare[Topic]##Sagging Face Mask[Topic]##My Skincare Routine[Topic]##Must-Have Tightening Mask[Topic]##Night Owls[Topic]##Treasure Mask[Topic]##Mask Sharing[Topic]##Anti-Aging[Topic]##Skincare Recommendation[Topic]##FUYUAN[Topic]##FUYUAN Tightening Mask[Topic]##FUYUAN Tightening Mask[Topic]#\n</Doc>\n",

Highly recommended! \nAs the Buddhist scriptures said: 'Mount Sumeru is hidden in a mustard seed, and a mustard seed contains Mount Sumeru,' but what about human nature? \nMustard Seed Part 1 and Part 2 real review comes here: \n(Trying to avoid spoilers, feel free to read)\nStore: Chengfu Exclusive\ndm: Mr. Ma, Penpen\nDuration: Two days (18h)\nPersonal Rating: 9 points and above! The best deductive script I've played as of 2024!\nTips before playing: Play Mirage and Fleeting beforehand (at least Fleeting), reserve enough energy and time. We split the game over two days, so it wasn't too exhausting...\nExperience:\nChangsha has Chengfu's exclusive store, and the store made reasonably good adaptations. Before the game, the dm will also give everyone a recap! You can try it without hesitation!! Mr. Ma is great! Every time I encounter a poorly written script, my complaints will overflow, but when it comes to a good one, I don‚Äôt know where to start writing about it... \nOverall, the experience was excellent. It‚Äôs been almost half a month since we finished the script, and there are still some unforgettable moments. However, as I‚Äôm relatively lazy and delayed it for a long time, this will only be a summary review (covering both parts)... \nPart 1 of Mustard Seed leans toward puzzle solving, with some deduction segments but not overly scary. Girls don‚Äôt need to worry; the deduction includes some key information. It‚Äôs a test of your memory. Although it doesn‚Äôt bring anything completely new to the table, our group still had tons of fun, filled with groan-worthy moments inside and outside the scenario... \nReturning to the script itself, Part 1 serves as a great bridge to the second part. Simultaneously, it provides a complete detective experience and doesn't fall short. A criticism some may have is that it can be hard to identify the riddles, making it challenging to start, which is understandable‚Äîafter all, who can entirely sync with the author's creativity? In summary, Part 1 might involve slightly more dimensions and offers plentiful content... \nPart 2 returns to roundtable reasoning, focusing on restoration. Personally, I prefer Part 2 because I love piecing the story together. Plus, our group had a 'restoration master' (lol), which made Part 2 extremely entertaining for us. The 'Pure Love War God' Wang Yang, the 'Masochist War God' Xu Chen, and the 'Gambling God' Modi‚Äîour team had so many ‚Äògods,‚Äô haha‚Ä¶ \nBack to the script itself: As the mysteries unravel layer by layer, you'll feel chills and marvel at the author‚Äôs schemes and designs. Following the rhythm of 'Alec Chuan,' can you really penetrate the fog and discover the truth? That‚Äôs something you‚Äôll need to experience yourself... \nDownsides:\n1. There are still perspective differences between characters. Some might feel marginal compared to the central characters, but it didn‚Äôt affect me much. Honestly, I felt a bit marginal, lol.\n2. Although the reading volume isn‚Äôt huge, integrating all the information (clues and scripts) requires a certain level of skill.\nConclusion:\nI think, despite the long consumption of time and energy, it‚Äôs absolutely worth it. It gave a very satisfying conclusion to the Fleeting series. There are some minor flaws, but they‚Äôre not fatal. Comparing it to a similar script from the same period, 'The Silent Scriptwriter,' it‚Äôs like heaven versus the abyss. Sorry for ranting about 'The Silent Scriptwriter,' haha. The ending discussion on good and evil also provokes deep thought. I hope 2024 will bring more excellent scripts like this!\n</Doc>\n",

Here is a food collection from a not-so-recent timeÔΩû\n\t\nPicture 1 Hong Ji Dim Dim Sum (Yuehu Shengyuan Store)\nüìç 73 Shengyuan Alley, Haishu District\nAn old popular internet-famous store, there‚Äôs no need to explain how delicious it is. Every time I order, I want to taste every dish. My favorite is the Red Rice Seafood Noodles and the Icy Hot Pineapple Bun. The crispy hot bread melts the icy butter, but for someone with a small appetite, I recommend eating only half. Although the portions aren‚Äôt big, they‚Äôre all very substantial, and you‚Äôll definitely leave feeling full.\n\t\nPicture 2 Haijia Ke ¬∑ Guangdong Beef and Mixed Pork Noodles\nüìç 331 Xiangyun North Road, Yinzhou District\nA medium-sized store. It‚Äôs always crowded in the evenings, so you have to share tables with others. I always order the Beef and Beef Ball Soup Noodles because I enjoy chewy staples and handmade noodles. Both rice noodles and kway teow here are good. Most importantly, the beef balls here are the best I‚Äôve ever had. The beef soup base is exceptionally fragrant due to the addition of celery and a little minced garlic. It‚Äôs my go-to place when I don‚Äôt know what else to eat.\n\t\nPicture 3 Qing He\nüìç 1-7, No. 232 Jiangdongbei Road, Yinzhou District\nI really like these beautifully decorated small-scale restaurants with fewer tables. The dishes aren‚Äôt particularly amazing, but the spicy garlic salt-baked sea prawns taste pretty good. The ‚ÄúAmber Queen‚Äù is a high-footed glass black coffee milk cap, which I enjoy a lot. A must-have for those who love a sense of ceremony.\n\t\nPicture 4 Fenghua A Xiao‚Äôs Beef Dry Noodles (Xinmalu Store)\nüìç Block 4, Lane 288, Xinmalu, Beianqin Senximen, Jiangbei District\nAfter trying the dry noodles in Doumen, Fenghua, I fell in love with them. This clear, flavorful soup with ample beef and refreshing dry noodles is something I can eat two bowls of. However, I care a lot about the environment, and to be honest, the setting isn‚Äôt suitable for someone like me with mild OCD to stay for long.\n\t\nPictures 5678 Xinrongji/Rong Xiaoji\nüìç Jiaojiang Central Avenue Store\nI must praise Xinrongji. The service is excellent, and the staff fulfilled all our peculiar requests, such as pastries opened within 10 minutes, live sand worms, and takeaway yellow-skinned fruits. The food is really delicious. We spent over 300 yuan per person, leaving uncomfortably full after the meal. The next day, we went to its sister brand Rong Xiaoji. Highly not recommended. The dishes were neither innovative nor particularly tasty. It's expensive and has long queues. Even though the turnover is quick, the queue was still long, and the dishes didn‚Äôt match the hype.\n\t\nPicture 9 A Barbecue Restaurant in the Alley ¬∑ River Snail Rice Noodles Grilled Fish ¬∑ Bullfrog (Hemeicheng Store)\nüìç 1-3, No. 32 Hemeicheng Plaza, Yangfan Road, Yinzhou District\nOn a whim, I wanted to eat there. When I called, the fish was already sold out, so I had bullfrog and river snail rice noodles, adding duck blood and chicken feet. The chicken feet were delicious. The bullfrog and river snail noodles were oilier than the grilled fish base I had before. After having light dishes for a long time, having something spicy and oily occasionally is okay.\n\t\nPictures 10 11 Shen Family Beef Noodles (High-Tech Plaza Store)/Mumu Fresh Seafood Noodles\nüìç No. 400 Juxian Road, High-Tech Plaza, Yinzhou District\nI recommend the 15 RMB beef bone broth.

        "content": "Query: \nWhich version of 'General History of China' is the best?\nLevel:\nName of the version\n\nDoc:\n<Doc>\nFacts are rigorous, the first choice for history beginners: Fu Lecheng's 'General History of China'‚ùóÔ∏è\nüìöBook Title: 'General History of China'\nüñåAuthor: Fu Lecheng\nüìñPublisher: Guizhou Education Press, 2010, 673 pages\n\t\nüåüSpent over 40 days (interspersed with reading other books, so took a bit longer) to finish Fu Lecheng's 'General History of China'. The feeling is that the narration of historical facts is rigorous, clear in structure, and easy to understand. If you want to build a framework of ancient Chinese history focusing on historical facts, this book can be the first choice for beginners.\n\t\nOther well-known comprehensive histories include Qian Mu's 'Outline of National History' and L√º Simian's 'General History of China.' Before reading, I made a comparison myself and finally chose Fu Lecheng's version of the general history.\n\t\nüåüFu Lecheng came from the renowned Fu family of historians, which produced many renowned historians noted for their rigorous scholarship. Fu's version of the general history adheres to the style of positive historiography, integrating traditional histories of various dynasties with the actual research findings of modern scholars as well as his own historical studies. It provides a concise account of historical facts and developments from the Paleolithic period to the late Qing dynasty.\n\t\nIn the book, Mr. Fu doesn't interject much of his personal commentary, striving to focus objectively on the facts. In terms of selecting historical materials, viewpoints lacking solid evidence and overly subjective statements are excluded.\n\t\nFu‚Äôs history takes the dynastic transitions as its outline, not only explaining the causes and consequences of each dynastic change but also describing aspects of the period such as political systems, economy, diplomacy, culture, and religion, making the content more thorough.\n\t\nüåøPersonally, I think the reading challenges are: first, obscure characters‚Äîthere are many rare characters in ancient place and personal names; a modern Chinese dictionary app or handwritten input method combined with a search engine can help. Second, during the historical transitions between dynasties, there are numerous events and figures, making the information overwhelming. Organizing the context yourself is necessary; otherwise, it becomes confusing.\n\t\nüåüL√º‚Äôs comprehensive history, as seen in its table of contents, is divided into two parts. The upper part covers 18 aspects such as marriage, family systems, and political systems; the lower part discusses politics. L√º Simian was erudite and an ancient history expert, recognized as the scholar who read the most history books in the field of history. However, considering this book of general history, it isn‚Äôt very beginner-friendly.\n\t\nThe whole book cites too much ancient history, written in a mix of semi-classical and semi-modern language, which creates reading barriers. Additionally, for topics like marriage and political systems, specialized works can be read separately. L√º gathered 18 topics together with wide-ranging sources, often interjecting his own commentary throughout his narration, which leads to a quick and surface-level overview of each aspect. After reading it, one might still feel clouded about how the history of each dynasty developed.\n\t\nüåüQian's general history works were written in a rather special era, so his personal historical perspective is strong, and there is a lot of personal insight and commentary. Many editions are in traditional Chinese and vertical layout, making them harder to read.\n\t\nI personally prefer to first understand the historical facts and build a historical framework before reading historians' commentary. Therefore, I chose Fu Lecheng's general history. If I were to recommend books in comprehensive history, Fu Lecheng's version would be my preference.\n\t\nüåàI bought the 2010 edition from Guizhou Education Press, secondhand from Kongfuzi old book store online. Other editions seem to have significantly abridged content. There are many books in comprehensive history; you can compare e-versions on WeChat Reading before deciding which physical book to purchase.\n\t\n  \n</Doc>\n",

Here is a small reference for everyone.\nüôã Must buy: Cream cheese bread bites, cheese bread, golden cheese bread, Tiramisu ice bread\nüôÜ Optional: Milk butter pineapple bread, cranberry steamed bread, original yogurt, egg cheese triangle, mini sausage bread, cheese tart bites, cocoa taro filling bread\nüôÖ Not recommended: Castella cake, milk fermented toast, taro pudding bread, crab-flavored Danish\n‚óè Cheese bread: Initially, I thought this was just a highly popular internet sensation. I bought it with a trial mindset, and honestly, it was incredibly delicious, worth repurchasing!!! The surface is covered with a thick layer of milk powder, and the bread is infused with a lot of cheese, giving it a slightly moist texture. It's not overly sweet or greasy, and I finished a large piece in one go‚Äîit‚Äôs highly addictive.\n‚óè Cream cheese bread bites: Recommended! This should be one of their signature items. A pack contains five small pieces. Topped with cheese crumbs, suitable for heating; the sweet and salty cheese filling inside leans slightly toward sweetness but is not at all greasy. It's very delicious.\n‚óè Tiramisu ice bread: This seems to be one of their latest offerings. I personally think it's great! The cream on top blends well with the coffee bread base underneath. The cream + cocoa restores the most authentic taste of tiramisu: not sweet, with a rich milky flavor. The bread base has a slight coffee flavor but is not moist, slightly dry. Eating both top and bottom together is perfect!\n‚óè Cheese tart bites: These are pretty good! The outer crust is crispy with the right thickness, while the inside resembles the taste of an egg tart filling, slightly smoother and more elastic. It has a strong milky aroma and is not overly sweet or greasy. Each bite is small, yet very filling.\n‚óè Taro pudding bread: Egg pudding + taro filling + brown sugar mochi, a three-layer combination shaped like a large egg tart, with the texture of an egg tart‚Äîsoft and tender. However, its fatal flaw is that it's overwhelmingly sweet, making it hard to eat more than two bites. Not recommended for those who dislike sweet foods!!!\n‚óè Egg cheese triangle: The top layer is baked cheese toast, with a filling of salad dressing + chopped egg + thin slices of sausage in the middle. Overall, it has a strong savory flavor, making it suitable for breakfast and quite cost-effective.\n‚óè Mini sausage bread: This bread is better when reheated; eating it directly is a bit too hard. The outer crust of cheese crumbs + salty sausage (similar to cured sausage taste, quite salty) gives it a salty flavor, without any sweetness. It's just okay.\n@FoodiesPotato @DeliciousUnlimitedCompany @ParisBaguetteCustomerService\n#XiaohongshuTrendingFood[Topic]# #ParisBaguette[Topic]# #ParisBaguetteReview[Topic]# #ParisBaguetteNewProducts[Topic]# #ParisBaguetteCheeseBread[Topic]# #BreadLovers[Topic]# #HandmadeBread[Topic]# #BeijingHandmadeBread[Topic]# #EuropeanBreadRecommendation[Topic]# #BeijingFood[Topic]# #BeijingFoodExploration[Topic]# #BeijingExploration[Topic]#\n</Doc>\n",

Hope it helps!\nüé£ Overview of popular Daiwa baitcasting reel models:\nüê†„ÄêCC80/CR80„Äë\nAs entry-level options, these two baitcasting reels offer excellent value for money and stable performance. The design of the 8080 is stylish, featuring a distinctive hollow spool. If you're on a budget, this is a great choice.\nüï∑Ô∏è„ÄêSpider Series„Äë\nThe new Black Spider 100 is known for its compact and practical design, while the classic models are also well-received. The upgraded 150/200/300 models have larger frames, increased line capacity, and stronger braking power, making them especially suitable for fishing for Chinese perch or snakehead fish, and handling complex obstacle areas with ease.\nüï∑Ô∏è„ÄêSpider SV70/80„Äë\nThese two models, launched simultaneously, stand out compared to the Spider 100. They differ in frame material and are popular among wild fishing enthusiasts. Equipped with the SV system, these reels provide more stable casting.\nü¶é„ÄêFire Chameleon 70 and SV70„Äë\nThe differences between the two mainly lie in appearance and drag functions. If you prefer more safety features, the Fire Chameleon 70 is a good choice. Spider // Sport Chameleon„Äë\nThose seeking long-cast performance will appreciate this series. Its superior casting ability is especially handy when using small lures, making it a boon for boat and light tackle fishing enthusiasts.\nüëâ„ÄêMid to High-End Series„Äë\n‚ú®„ÄêAlpha„Äë\nStylish with a comfortable grip and lightweight design, this model is suitable for general light lures. The Alpha SV excels in casting stability and performance but lacks a drag alarm function.\n‚ú®„ÄêAlpha Air„Äë\nThe perfect companion for delicate fishing, with fast startup on small lures. It can start casting at 1 gram and handle micro-fishing or 10-12 gram lures with ease. The Moonlight baitcasting reel is also a good choice.\n‚ú®„Äê21 Zillion„Äë\nGreat for general small lures, equipped with a unique SV braking system and featuring a silver-gray body design. It offers a broader lure weight range and stronger braking power compared to the Alpha while providing a drag alarm system. „ÄêZillion 1514/1516„Äë\nThe 1514 combines great aesthetics and performance, suitable for both freshwater and saltwater environments and for casting heavy lures long distances. However, be cautious of backlashes at the terminal end. The 1516 features a full black design, lighter weight, and is designed specifically for freshwater use.\nüëâ„ÄêSteez Top Series„Äë\nüéâ„ÄêSteez Ltd„Äë\nThis flagship model has a futuristic frame design, a sleek silver body, and a compact grip. Its casting performance is stable, and the shallow spool version is more suitable for delicate fishing.\nüéâ„ÄêSteez CT SV„Äë\nThis model is currently rare on the market and is priced on the higher side, making it unsuitable for beginners.\nüéâ„ÄêSteez ATW HLC„Äë\nEquipped with the HLC distance casting spool, it's an ideal choice for handling big fish and offers strong performance.\nüéâ„ÄêSteez Air„Äë\nWith a compact body and designed for delicate fishing, it can handle lures under 10 grams with ease. However, it might not perform as well as the Alpha when dealing with heavier lures.\nüé£üéâ #BaitcastingReel[Topics]# #LureFishing[Topics]# #LureGear[Topics]# #BeginnerLureFishing[Topics]# #BeginnerLure[Topics]# #MicroLureFishing[Topics]# #StreamLureFishing[Topics]# #Daiwa[Topics]##BaitcastingReel[Topics]##MicroBaitcastingReel[Topics]##DaiwaSpinningReel[Topics]##LureRod[Topics]##SpinningReel[Topics]#\n</Doc>\n",

Storage: Must pair with a battery module, otherwise only 28GB is available.\nHowever, all these shortcomings didn‚Äôt outweigh the appeal of the 800 price tag:\n1. Heat issue: Later I bought a rabbit cage; at a room temperature of 28¬∞C, I recorded continuously for 3 hours without overheating or shutting down, even while charging.\n2.

The principle is identical, only the position of the openings varies, leading to structural differences.\n\nAs for baby colic, it ultimately stems from the baby‚Äôs underdeveloped gastrointestinal system, and the air inhaled while feeding is only part of the reason. We should not over-worry about it but focus on what we can do: proper use of bottles and nipples, effective burping, and patiently waiting with love for the baby‚Äôs digestive system to mature.\n\nIf I were to choose, I would still go with the classic Pigeon bottle. It‚Äôs not that others aren't good enough, but the Pigeon bottle offers a better cost-performance ratio overall. As a first-time mom, my blind choice worked well for me~\n\nPigeon is more baby-friendly:\nThe nipple is made of bionic silicone material, soft and elastic, closer to a mother‚Äôs breast, and easier for the baby to accept;\nIt offers nipples with segmented flow rates to suit babies of different ages, ensuring milk flows evenly and smoothly without choking;\nThe anti-colic nipple design prevents the baby from inhaling too much air.\nGrape quickly accepted the Pigeon bottle on her first try and happily became a little foodie~\n\nPigeon is more parent-friendly:\nThe nipple mimics the state of breastfeeding, fitting the latch-on line and preventing air swallowing and colic. It works for anyone feeding the baby; latch-on is quick and precise;\nThe wide-neck design is simple, making preparing formula and cleaning easier;\nThe material is safe, non-toxic, high-temperature resistant, and can be sterilized.\n#NewMom[Topic]##BabyBottle[Topic]##Newborn[Topic]##PigeonBottle[Topic]##DrBrownBottle[Topic]##ComotomoBottle[Topic]##NewbornBottle[Topic]##Physics[Topic]##ResearchLife[Topic]#\n</Doc>\n",

However, I couldn't secure an appointment and ended up booking Geng Xinming over the phone. Reviews about this doctor on Xiaohongshu were mixed, so I gave it a try mainly because I couldn't book any other doctors.\n\nThe first visit was at 15 weeks + 4 days. I initially went to get a mid-pregnancy tang test.

According to him, any resulting problem wasn‚Äôt his responsibility.\n\nExtremely frustrating!!! He kept contradicting himself about whether fasting was needed üôÇ\n\nLater, after the blood draw, I found out he didn't issue me an anomaly scan request. So, I went back to him, and he gave me a check-up order worth 1500 RMB (like for a Mediterranean anemia test, thyroid function, etc., all of which I had already done before pregnancy!!!!). Then he directly gave me a third-trimester anomaly scan order, suggesting an earlier free second-trimester one at 18 weeks and self-funded third-trimester anomaly scan at 23 weeks.\n\nLater, at the nurse station, they told me I didn‚Äôt have free vouchers. After running around, I found out from the community hospital that since I had booked an appointment at another hospital before, I couldn't double-book for the second-trimester anomaly scan. (But last time Geng Xinming said I could rebook at their hospital. When my husband asked him further, he coldly replied to us, \"Do whatever you want. You can get checked wherever you want to go.\")\n\nLater, we called the original hospital, and they explained the Provincial Maternity and Child Health Hospital liked scheduling anomaly scans at 18 weeks, which is basically useless, so you'd have to pay out of pocket for a third-trimester anomaly scan. However, their 23-week appointment was at the correct timing and not a mistake. (Geng Xinming kept scaring me, saying that anomaly scans at 23 weeks weren‚Äôt necessary and wouldn‚Äôt be valuable.)\n\nI wasted 3 hours in this hospital... Definitely avoiding this doctor in the future. Is there any way to file a complaint against him? He just wants to issue expensive orders without taking any responsibility. After I left, I heard a young man quarreling loudly with him, but I don't know the details. I can only confirm that this doctor has an extremely poor attitude!!! Definitely avoid!!! Pregnant women should have a good mood, but visiting him only leads to frustration. He even throws the medical records straight at you! [DisappointedR][DisappointedR][DisappointedR] \n</Doc>\n",

Today, Big Wen is recommending a long pure love novel! \"Infrastructure Starts from the Multiverse General Store\" by the author Weizhang Jinting. The full text is now completed!\nThe protagonist runs a small general store that trades goods across different dimensions. It's easy to assume from this setup that it's a management story, but the author's focus is not merely on running the general store. Instead, it delves more into infrastructure development and aiding the construction of order in various dimensions.\nThere are three dimensions in total‚Äîprimitive, cultivation, and Western fantasy‚Äîentered sequentially in time order. However, this doesn't mean the plot of the previous dimension ends upon entering the next. Stories from all dimensions unfold simultaneously and interweave in various ways.\nThe hallmark of the author is the meticulous writing style full of human warmth. The stories of various people in each world and the changes brought by the protagonist are written with great detail. Lovers of such writing will feel deeply immersed, while those who dislike it might find it a bit drawn-out or too slow-paced.\nThe romantic subplot follows the same pattern. The characters are quite appealing‚Äîa naive and strong young man rescued by the protagonist from a primitive tribe. The cold-faced general store owner and the innocent beautiful boy‚ÄîI was totally hooked! However, in the early stages, they both like each other but never break the tension. The mutual ambiguity persists until near the end when they finally get together, which drove me crazy with anticipation.\nOverall, if you can accept a slow pace and enjoy management and infrastructure themes, this is worth checking out! #NovelRecommendation[Topic]# #BookRescue[Topic]# #BookShortage[Topic]# #Recommendation[Topic]# #DailyRecommendation[Topic]# #PureLove[Topic]# #Infrastructure[Topic]# #SlowPaced[Topic]#\n</Doc>\n",
